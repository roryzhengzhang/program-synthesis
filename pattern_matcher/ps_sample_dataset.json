However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \n\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur√©e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \n\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.","date":"2014-10-11 03:34:02"}

Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary.

However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \n\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows.

I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\n\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\n\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients.

The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\n\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \n\nI believe I've made a great investment.

Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!\n\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\n\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\n\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\n\nI have to say . . . I'm \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\n\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn't) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\n\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .","date":"2009-10-13 22:20:10"}

I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\n\nIt's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\n\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great.

Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!\n\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\n\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\n\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\n\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\n\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese \/ gorgonzola yumminess.","date":"2008-04-30 01:39:05"}

However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\n\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\n\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.\n\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.","date":"2011-11-29 23:53:15"}

But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.

That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes.

We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping.

They certainly don't skip on the injera here. \n\nMy favorite part about this place specifically is that they serve the food traditional style in colorful baskets!

I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn't drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn't help at all so I don't know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn't like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don't care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.

We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \n\nFor the entr√©e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting.

They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\n\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas!

I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.

You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\n\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\n\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\n\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\n\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.

The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting.

We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \n\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \n\nThere are some things that were still delicious.

Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!\n\nNow buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\n\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \n\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \n\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\n\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits\/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \n\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...","date":"2016-11-09 20:46:13"}

And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \n\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target\/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\n\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself.

The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\n\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\n\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\n\nSeeing his site (http:\/\/www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\n\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\n\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.","date":"2012-11-06 03:30:52"}

When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\n\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones.

He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \n\nLet's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997\/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \n\nI left with a horrible tattoo.

I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \n\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \n\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \n\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\n\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\n\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\n\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil.

Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \n\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \n\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \n\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\n\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  \nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \n\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.","date":"2015-10-07 21:48:25"}

The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other.

My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \n\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \n\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria.

I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1's mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the 'Haute Dog' made it. \n\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you're looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\n\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the 'Oaxaca' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there'd be. Always a plus!\n\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there's a muti flavor component to them as well. \n\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\n\nMy one tiny complaint\/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small.

But even with my modest expectations, I was seriously disappointed with this place. The tools used for my pedicure and manicure looked overused and unsanitary, the women in the salon carried on a conversation at the top of their lungs the entire time I was there, and my nails were unevenly shaped. I will definitely be finding another salon in the area.","date":"2014-08-10 19:27:13"}

I have been wanting to go for awhile but Husband (never having had tapas) was resistant (although he loves seafood, rice and ham - go figure!). Thanks goodness for the power outage last week! I convinced him to go here (\"like dim sum honey- only Spanish food...you know, like jamon???!!!\"). From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can't imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on. He chatted with us for awhile and it was most enjoyable.\nCannot wait to go back!\nPros: everything\nCons: need more friends so we can order more variety :)","date":"2017-11-06 18:16:26"}

Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\n--------------------------\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom's closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I'm a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\n\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That's fine with me.\"\n\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office!

I had seen so many good reviews that I couldn't wait, especially since I am terrible at doing my own hair! The atmosphere immediately excited me- music, movies, laughter...I felt like I was at a club! The women working were so nice and my stylist was super friendly. I told her I wanted loose waves and she definitely did that. The reason for two stars, however, is that my hair looked great at the salon, but 25 minutes later all of my curls fell and my hair was straight. I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out.

And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done.

I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. \n\nI came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.\n\nI saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, \"that's what supply and demand is.\" And walked away.\n\nI would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.\n\nYour \"lesson\" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. \n\nI know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.\n\nSincerely,\nFormer Kreuger farms fan","date":"2013-06-24 07:14:55"}

I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\n\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small.

We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice.

My husband goes crazy for the Croque Madame - he's had it at other places in Vegas and even Paris, and still feels they couldn't touch the one served here! \n\nAll of their salads, les frites, les moules au pistou, le saumon, I could go on and on. I've never been disappointed here - everything is absolutely delicious. Their daily specials are always a delight as well! Don't forget to try one of their cocktails or have a glass of wine off of their great list. \n\nBon appetit!","date":"2014-04-01 02:29:55"}

Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\n\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.","date":"2009-10-13 03:48:11"}

Very minimal. I got most of what I asked for, but upon a closer look my nails (which are naturally grown) were definitely not almond shaped. They're honestly only slightly different in shape than what I came in with. And as I was getting my nails filed by the first lady, she said that she usually charges $7 extra for filing almond-shaped nails, but because it was my first time she would waive the fee--which was nice of her, but I didn't know people charged extra for certain shapes! Or maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to nail salons (this was my first time going in about 7+ years). The other woman who gave me the manicure (not the same who shaped my nails) did an OK job. She was polite and friendly, and the coat was even. But the dots didn't all have a consistent size and one of them is totally crooked. But honestly, I could live with the lopsided dots. It's the shape I'm really disappointed about. I thought \"almond\" is a universal shape and thus that she knew what I meant--even after showing her a picture. \n\nThe plus side is that my mani only cost about $30 but it's still more than I would've paid for not getting the right shape. Maybe what I wanted was too simple. Or maybe they just didn't understand what I wanted.

Honestly, I believe this is where most Nepali restaurants fail to deliver. \n\nTibetan\/Himalayan,  Newari,  Indian\/Madeshi  alongwith regional fares (I would be hard press to express this entirely) is what makes Nepali food. The curries, dumplings and noodles are all there, but they are different. This restaurant does it the best in Boston area.","date":"2016-03-17 14:21:35"}

Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer...one of my Austin favs.  The beer variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle.  The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin\/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.  Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates.  Come to think of it, I didn't really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli.\n\nThere is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories.  Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks (I wish I would've known about this place when I bought mine) and candies.

Well, turns out it was MUCH easier than that; in fact, I never had to go online at all! I picked out beautiful trendy frames and a salesperson measured my face in about 5 seconds using this thing that looks like a simple cardboard box. When I told her that my prescription was pretty strong (around a -5.5), they said no problem. They took my optometrist's phone number, swiped my card, got my email address and -POOF- the next day I got an email saying they'd gotten my prescription from the optometrist. One week later, my gorgeous new glasses came in the mail! Please understand that I know what good glasses are and how they should fit. I've been in glasses forever and have bought just about every designer at one point or another. And these really are GREAT glasses.

I even went running in them this morning. So comfortable! I'm truly thrilled with the service I received at this store, their attention to the nuances of fit, and with the company in general. They make a wonderful product at a great price, and they're charitable to boot. What else can you ask for?!","date":"2018-01-09 20:15:08"}

I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.\n\nThe food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\n\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\n\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\n\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here! I later learned that not all the rooms were like this, only on our wing.","date":"2016-08-25 15:42:13"}

Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.\n\nMarvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.\n\nWhen she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.\n\nFor herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.\n\nThe portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.\n\nThe rest of us shared two ¬º Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter \/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.\n\nI liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!\n\nWe enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.\n\nThough we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.  They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils.\n\n3.5 stars, rounded up for their making amends.\n\nThey are open daily, and close at 8pm.","date":"2014-08-24 20:35:10"}

I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\n\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\n\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server\/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\n\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\n\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\n\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.","date":"2015-11-18 19:21:19"}

I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair . I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair. Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice!

It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\n\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees.

I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\n\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\n\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\n\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.","date":"2014-01-17 02:43:30"}

It is all depending on what you order.  I used to be a big fan of their Chirashi.  If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17.  I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same.  In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing.  Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs).  They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado.  Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice.  I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there.  Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent.  So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant.  I really wanted our relationships last a little longer.","date":"2016-12-19 15:18:19"}

It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  \n\nThe hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it. I feel bad for whoever our neighbors were.  \n\nThis hotel is also the only establishment we visited in Vancouver where I encountered irritated staff and sub par customer service.  Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  \n\nThe WiFi was slow but free.  \n\nDon't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.  It takes a solid hour for the restaurant to make its turn, so unless you want to spend $50 on drinks or milk one for an hour, just go up there and walk around it and you'll get the gist.

The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.\n\nThe biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.\n\nThe fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.\n\nI ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.

I would come again JUST for the fries. Overall though, it was a disappointment. Not bad enough to complain about and send back, but almost. Sorry to be so harsh...","date":"2017-06-06 18:50:12"}

The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!  If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery.","date":"2016-08-25 13:39:33"}

The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.\nHowever, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her \"magic card\", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.\nOverall I'm very happy with their work and the price so I'll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!","date":"2014-04-01 03:21:50"}

Wow, this place gets crazy busy sometimes. The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.\n\nI also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.\n\nI tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good. The decor is pretty decent too, with some fun murals to look at. There is plenty of parking if you go around back, which is just a short walk away.","date":"2015-03-04 19:31:39"}

Read this entire post to understand this update. \n\nI usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. \n\nOkay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. \n\nThey guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. \n\nHere's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. \"You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here.\" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. \n\nOh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon.","date":"2015-03-04 20:32:47"}

His response was that wasn't his job. \n\nThe last time I went they left the oil cap off the car, it wasn't until several hours later when the car started running rough that I found the cap on top of the engine block, they claimed they didn't leave the cap off. It was a big mess and it smelled like oil for weeks.\n\nOverall: I would PASS on this location based on rude customer service and lack the knowledgeable on the jobs they are performing.","date":"2016-01-04 02:57:21"}

The owner is an older bald man- he runs the store with his equally bald son. I don't know about the son, but the owner is very knowledgable about his animals and really seems to care about them, though he runs his shop like a business as to be expected. The store is small and cramped and is often dirty, but this is to be expected at a small, independently owned pet shop. This man told me he has had this store for 40 years!\n\nWe talked about rabbits (I have a Holland Lop) and he told me about how he was taking care of a Holland Lop rabbit that someone had literally dumped on the sidewalk outside of his store. His dogs (including a giant friendly Newfoundland named Sammy) and a pair of black-and-white cats serve as greeters and mascots of the store.\n\nI personally was not affronted by the smell of the place. Yes, it smells, but when don't animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn't smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit's cage after a few days. The owner lets the parrots in the back of the store roam around sometimes and it's pretty dirty in that back room, so if you are willy nilly about those things, don't go back there.\n\nThe prices are a bit high here but I consider that the price of supporting a family business. \n\nTo address the claim of \"animal cruelty\" and \"unscrupulous breeding,\" I have never witnessed anything to say this. I will agree that a couple of the parrots have medical issues (there is one who likes to pull out some of his feathers), but I also know the owner often takes in rescued animals.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place. If you are looking for a spic-and-span, glossy-floored store like Petco, go to Petco.","date":"2013-01-02 15:23:16"}

When John Travolta whined about the cost of a shake in Pulp Fiction he was astonished to pay five dollars for an Ice cream drink. If he came here, he might tear off his hair piece in frustration. So unless you are a cost-conscious Scientologist, you will likely enjoy Menchie's.","date":"2014-07-28 02:20:14"}

Love the comic strip type art in the bathroom. \n\nOn to the food, we had a set menu with three courses, first course was tapa dishes, which we had about 7 of. My favorite was the ceviche although the octopus was a bit over cooked it was delicious , with the most perfectly cooked scallop to top it. Everything was tasty and unique. \n\nSecond course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. \n\nThird course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part.  We had creme br√ªl√©e, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! \n\nThis place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit!\n\nNow let me tell you also, we had a few friends at dinner who had food allergies, Barlata went above and beyond with separate menus which were also full of flavor and uniquely put together. It was great!So many times I've seen my friends get served plates of boiled veggies because of their allergies but they felt very included here. Nice job Barlata!","date":"2016-12-19 15:17:28"}

I would have given 4 stars but removed 2 for a failure of integrity for a customer oriented business. I shop big, & very recently since October 2013 having moved to a location close to Moody Street, have started to shop here. I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity\/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \n\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't\/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right. So here I am looking for another shop.....","date":"2014-02-23 23:30:56"}

It opened a few weeks ago and I finally got there today.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  The staff is not just passive, but unpleasant. More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an \"excuse me\".  They had carts of merchandise stacked up, waiting to be shelved, blocking shoppers. The cashier situation was the worst. A customer in front of me had a return\/credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction.  I brought my own bags and bagged myself (as I prefer) but when all my items were rung up, the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags.

We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table.

I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place.

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. \n\nI would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.","date":"2014-06-11 15:34:50"}

I live in St. Johns and go there at least 3 times a week with my dog to wear her out. I spend most of my time on the Newton Road trailhead and have a few loops around there that I love to watch change with the seasons. \n\nConfession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \n\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \n\nAnyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them.","date":"2012-10-08 19:06:32"}

I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite.\n\nAnd they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up.

There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.\n\nSpeaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking \"different\" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.\n\nNot having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was \"for real.\"  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http:\/\/workingclassacupuncture.org\/?id=7\n\nAt this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  \n\nThe interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  \n\nWCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  \n\nWCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!","date":"2015-02-24 05:43:21"}

After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident , I was not given the number to their manager , while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin, cheeks , jaw line, upper lip, and forehead. Come on? Really, why would anyone use so much strength on a facial???? And these people are supposed to be TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. I've never had problems with Dermalogica products. I'm not coming back. As I'm writing this post my face is still burning - I went in at 8:30 pm and it's now 10:44 and I'm holding ice to my face because it feels like sun burn.\nUpdate: received a call from from the Lead she was helpful and left some items for me to pick up to fix the problem, I called the manager Darcy wanting to follow up with her as well and she had left me a voice message.  She was understanding at first and as soon as I told her I wanted to cancel my membership , instead of receiving CUSTOMER SERVICE, she had the audacity to remind me of a time I paid using my \"boyfriends credit card\", wow I'm so disgusted with this place - so irrelevant and uneducated response.

At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf.

What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. \n\nTried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! \n\nOverall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!","date":"2018-04-15 08:35:00"}

The food is pretty good (depending on what you get), and the service is always stellar. Some of those waiters have an attitude on them, but you just gotta snap those queens in their place! But seriously, it is all in good fun; I have never had a bad experience!!\n\nThe beer is cheap, and all the martini's are $5.

Parking can be tricky, there is a very small parking lot, but there is usually a place down the street or across the road, for pay.

We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. \nThe place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130.

Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a\/c not working so well, I didn't like the size\/layout of the room.

The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice!

I've eaten in once and had take-out once.  Dining in one afternoon at 4pm I decided to sit at the bar with (as my lady friends put it) the Spanish version of Fabio.  He was nice, albeit rather slow and seemed to be new at his job.  I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.\n\nI opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  \n\nA note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.\n\nThe tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico\/onions\/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.\n\nUnfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings\/condiments didn't add up.  \n\nYes, I'll be back to try more tacos, maybe some beers after work.  And if you like oysters I overheard the woman next to me talk about $0.25 oysters available one day of the week (Tuesday, perhaps?).","date":"2011-06-29 04:09:31"}

This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\n\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n\nMy whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble.","date":"2015-12-05 04:22:59"}

I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords\/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.\n\nWith Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.\n\nEvery single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.\n\nOn top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired.","date":"2013-04-10 16:13:52"}

I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.\n\n2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1\/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.\n\n3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded.

There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce\/gravy\/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don't interest me much.  \n\nI've had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I've had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It's usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I've sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I've tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it's more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  \n\nThe beverage selection doesn't dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  \n\nService is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.

They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. \n\nWhen you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. \n\nThe menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. \n\nFrom charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). \n\nI also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) \n\nThe burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. \n\nThe hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. \n\nOverall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.","date":"2014-12-17 18:39:32"}

I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads\/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge\/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That's it, rant done.","date":"2012-04-28 20:04:26"}

There is one specific brand\/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot. I had assumed that it was a national chain, but MW is in fact locally owned and the owner was in the store. They have a lot of mattresses in their showroom, all there to be tested out. \n\nRachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate. So we've got the price and set a delivery date for three weeks out at a particular time on Sunday, and the delivery guys arrive exactly on time, set up the new mattress with no drama, and take away the old mattress.

Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. \n\nSecond, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. \n\nThird, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. \n\nfourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives\/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) \n\nThe burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\n\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \n\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger.

The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \n\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \n\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\n\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.\n\nDinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.

I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\n\nThe atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\n\nI loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \n\nThe owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\n\nI cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \n\nWe finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray!

However, the staff is kinda rude. My party of 4, one of which was from out of town, showed up at 9:30 pm. We live in Milwaukie so it was kinda a trek to get there. This particular experience was the worst and embarrassing because I talked up the place to my out of town guest. As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, \"we are closing in 30 minutes!\". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving.  We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich?  The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. \nI am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out. The neighborhood was a buzz with people walking around. Other bars and restaurants were open and packed. I won't bother going back.

We were not aware of what that really mean, and we saw that he added one more avocado to the mix of the guacamole. Later on, we found out that the one extra avocado indeed cost us the full amount of additional order of the guacamole. We were charged for two guacamole when we are getting an order of guacamole with an extra avocado in the same container. If we were told that the extra avocado would cost us $12.00, we would go ahead to placed two separate order of the guacamole instead. In that case, we are really getting two guacamoles, and not one guacamole with an extra avocado.\n\nWhen we compare out guacamole to the \"single\" order of guacamole at the table next to use, they both looked about the same.\n\nThere is no way that extra avocado should cost $12.00, I am perfectly OK if they charged $6.00 extra for each additional avocado, but adding just one more avocado to the existing order would turn it into a double order, that would be too much.","date":"2017-03-27 00:43:20"}

I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \n\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \n\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \n\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \n\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \n\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.","date":"2016-03-07 00:29:22"}

Given it was a full tour, this could be done!\nCritique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. \nPart two in the store:\nfriendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day.  We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade.  Both were very good.  But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere.\n\nThe slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating.  This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place  with some attention to detail.  I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review.  That will keep this a half full review.","date":"2015-07-03 19:57:55"}

My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \n\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \n\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \n\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\n\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \n\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \n\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\n\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \n\nWe will not be back.","date":"2016-10-13 20:36:16"}

First of all, I love the name of this place. I had never been here before but my friend recommended it as she lived in the area. The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. \n\nI really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age. I can't wait to go back. An awesome bubble tea gem!","date":"2014-08-10 21:00:32"}

My plan is to return with my man, have a couple drinks, some pork cracklins and black-eyed pea fritters, and call it a night.\n\nOn the drink side, the menu was nice. Turn the page to get past the $10 house cocktails, as the second page has the $6 ones. I had a Harvey Wallbanger, quite nice. My friend had a sazerac which he enjoyed.\n\nAll in all we had a great experience. Total tab was $55. The decor was comfortable, not at all as overwrought or kitschy as I was expecting. We sat in the back on the rounded booth which was quite comfortable. The noise level was very acceptable until just before we left when the place was packed, about 8:30pm on a Thu. And Ria was playing hostess. She was extremely welcoming, and gave us our pick of table.  \n\nI consider this a great addition to the hood.

The plus is when one happens to magically choose the \"freshest\" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.\n\nOur consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.  There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories.","date":"2014-10-11 15:17:38"}

They carry a TON of juices, but i found them to be of poorer quality than many other brands i have tried. The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. \n\nAlso of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice\/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.\n\nI did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way. It completely messed my palette up for a day and the resin really stuck in my tank even when i used a neutralizer\/rinse and changed the coil (ive tried several brands\/flavors and never had that issue). I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.\n\nThe prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted\/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors. While the sheer amount of options was impressive, and the service was pretty good, the options themselves werent high quality. I give this place an a-ok rating because of the service\/space itself (they have a good selection of equipment too) but i will stick to other vape shops going forward.","date":"2015-02-02 06:02:22"}

It started out with the bartender being extremely rude to us for no reason. He made fun of my friend's drink choice and acted like it was a chore to serve us. It was incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling. When we got seated, the waitstaff was clearly overworked and had no interest in us as customers. We got the mussels and a quarter of the shells were empty. The rest were literally the smallest mussels I've ever eaten. Then it took 45 minutes for our entrees and that was only after speaking with the manager. Overall the customer experience was awful and I will never eat there or recommend there again. The food was even mediocre.","date":"2014-10-11 04:27:51"}

She actually said that. I'm no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn't been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. \n\nWhen I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.\n\nThen, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don't just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. \n\nWhen I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. \n\nSo now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog's \"200% Peace of Mind Promise,\" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *\"only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.\" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn't exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work.","date":"2015-01-03 21:58:57"}

They've taken A LOT of stuff off, added huge unnecessary pictures to hide the fact that they have about 15 items now,  and increased their prices.\n\n new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement.  Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off.  When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread.  Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge.  \n\nWhen you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here.  Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, \"so, if you want to pay for it...\" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  \n\nA lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.\n\nThey are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.  Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere.","date":"2014-08-10 22:54:57"}

I do not agree that 1\/500 customers are vegan. That statistic is misguided. What source are you getting your information? Secondly , I was invited to your restaurant for dinner and had no choice.  Having said that I feel your establishment just was not the right fit for me . Thank you for being honest and best of luck.","date":"2015-01-03 23:05:48"}

Despite it being middle of the lunch hour the place was not packed, only two people in line in front of me.  The cashier was efficient though not very courteous.  I ordered the Classic 1\/3 pound Thick Burger (which similar to McDonalds' 1\/3 pounder is also made of Angus beef), small fries and a small drink.  I got a plastic number tag to place on my table.  \nThe washroom was not very dirty or stinky but it could have used a flush and a scrub.  My food arrived at my table after less than 5 minutes (it's nice that you don't have to wait by the cashier for your name or number to be called), but without my drink, so I had to go and get a cup from the cashier.  The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  \nThe hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  \nThe burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  \nThe place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  \nI did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  \nThere is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. \nThe front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.

They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other \"teenager\/young adult premium wear\" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.\n\nThe quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. \n\nAlthough their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail.\n\nAs far as customer service\/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.\n\nWe quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!\n\nI also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between \"rise\", \"fit\", \"leg opening\", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size\/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want.","date":"2016-09-06 02:18:00"}

Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening's dining experience.  \n\nThe previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  \n\nWhenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word \"bliss\".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  \n\nIt was simply perfect.","date":"2009-08-04 03:10:37"}

Despite the fact that it's not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.\n3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.\n4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren't too spicy. I don't even put dressing on it.\n5.

I'm not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it's not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.\n2. I can't drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great\n3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, \"I have to go there again soon!\"\n4. It is pricey.

Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints.\n\nSo I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.\n\nI called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.\n\nI decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.\n\nYou get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)\n\nOn moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we'll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.\n\nAnd they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.\n\nThey took less than 2 1\/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.\n\nAt the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. \n\nThese guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.\n\nIt was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.\n\nThis move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.\n\nI could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly.","date":"2011-02-13 15:54:17"}

Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet.

We're pretty picky about our food - particularly coffees, teas, and desserts - but Octane never disappoints.  (Neither, for the record, does Cakes & Ale.)\n\nPros:\n-The baked goods from Little Tart Bakeshop are truly divine.  The meringues, chocolate\/caramel tarts, and basque tarts are particular favorites.  You can tell that all of the ingredients are high-quality, the recipes are tried-and-true, and the bakers are highly skilled.\n-I'm a tea drinker, and I am thrilled that Octane offers loose-leaf Rishi Tea.  Yay!\n-I'm not a coffee drinker, but my parents are, and they both very much enjoy the coffee at Octane.  They are extremely picky when it comes to coffee, so this is definitely a compliment. \n-In contrast to other reviewers, I've found the waitstaff to be perfectly pleasant and polite every time I've been there.  The male cashier with the gage earrings and the tattoos is particularly friendly and helpful.  Of course, I have only been here a handful of times, so who knows?\n-It's a neat loft space with high ceilings, plenty of light, and a rustic retro feel.\n-Although the patrons (and servers) largely appear to be \"hipsters,\" unlike other reviewers, I have never personally had an issue with any of them being judgey, impolite, or at all unpleasant during my visits to Octane.  That said, I've only been here a few times myself.\n\nCons:\n-The chairs (as other reviewers have mentioned) are small, hard, and singularly uncomfortable.  \n-Most of the tables wobble.\n-In the summertime, the shop is virtually un-airconditioned, with two tiny ceiling fans providing next-to-no air circulation.  This makes it particularly difficult to enjoy a hot tea, which is my preferred beverage, when I'm already sweltering.  I can only imagine how overheated the servers, cooks, and bakers must be hanging out over ovens and stoves in the back.  However, the temperature is fine during other seasons of the year.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Octane + the Little Tart Bakeshop  However, you may want to wait it out until slightly cooler months of the year to enjoy their delectable desserts and delicious drinks.  Although I've never had them myself, my family has told me that their sandwiches and quiches are also wonderful.  If possible, it would be great if the chairs, tables, and AC could be fixed, but otherwise this place is truly excellent, and the food & drinks are perfect.  Yum!","date":"2014-08-10 22:38:34"}

Austin Property Inspections did a terrible job inspecting the condo I just purchased. I had a friend who is also an inspector come look at the condo before the API official inspection. My friend's license is expired so he could not do the official report for me. My friend found several things that Samuel at API did not find, one of them requiring major electrical repair. At my friend's urging, I had an electrician come and access the house and it needed more than $800 worth of electrical work in repairs that API missed. Because API did not document the electrical problems, the seller refused to reimburse that cost. In addition, the refrigerator was not working properly and when I asked Gary at API about it, he told me they do not look at appliances like the refrigerator, that is not inluded in the inspection. I ended up having to buy a new refrigerator because of their neglect to let me know it did not work. So, the $400 I paid API  for the inspection was waste of money.

I, being a member of the latter team (read: clumsy), did not do well here. In my defense, it was my first time. \n\nA little background first. Personal shortcoming- I suck at chopsticks. I can play piano, paint fine detail, french braid hair, write in fancy scripts, yet somehow I haven't mastered the ability to grasp rice with two sticks. Eating here at Kaze was like every embarrassing chopstick failure I've ever had, but amped up to the Nth degree. Basically, I found myself trying to skewer what appeared to me to be raw cold cuts, cooking it in boiling broth, losing the coldcut in the broth 3 or 4 times, overcooking it while frantically trying to fish it out, and quickly shoving it into my mouth, with broth gracefully running down my ladylike chin. Awesome. The payoff, in terms of tastiness, was not comparable to the effort it required, IMHO.\n\nMy dining companion, who was attempting to explain protocol, was appalled. He had to remind me several times not to use the same utensil that I originally picked the raw cold cut up with. Okay, so I suck. I suck at chopsticks, I suck at Shabu Shabu, and I suck at life. \n\nTruth be told, I just wasn't into it. I don't see myself trying this again.\n\n*If you like this style though, I am told that this is one of the best Shabu spots in all of Boston!","date":"2013-05-07 08:06:55"}

It was stuffed with bacon, carrots, and celery and served with grilled creamed corn, which was delicious. The polenta cake seemed out of place and did not really add to the dish other than a stomach filler.\nFor dessert, we tried the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream was icy and had chunks of salt in it, which I did not like. The cake was dense, a bit on the dry side, and kind of like a flattened brownie--I would not order it again.\nService was a little slow even though we were 1 of 2 tables for the majority of our meal.

I usually get the tofu teriyaki bowl, which consists of tofu (not deep fried which is HUGE in my book) brown rice, fresh veggies and a sweetish teriyaki sauce.   It's my go-to healthy option for lunch and it's consistently good every time.  \n\nToday I strayed form the norm and decided on the veggie burger and un-fries (insert eye roll here, un-fries?).  I must admit that the fries are tasty.  They barely made it back to the office.  They were a bit oilier than I thought baked fries should be but that just made them tastier I suppose.  The veggie burger was ok.  Nothing to scream about.  I got it with everything on it which made it messy on the scale of a double whopper.  It had a bit too much of everything on it and some sort of seasoned salt on the veggie burger itself that was unevenly applied causing me to get mouthfuls of saltiness.  That being said the lettuce and tomato were very fresh and the bun was whole wheat and soft.  I think if I had scaled back on the toppings and asked for no salt I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my burger I noticed some other people's food coming out of the kitchen.  The entrees and hot wraps looked good from where I was standing.\n\nSome posts here say that the place is pricey and I'll admit that it's no McDonalds.  No dollar menu.  However my veggie burger was about $5 and the fries were $1.79.  The burger was huge and the fries were a normal \"small fry\" portion.  Pricey for fast food?  Maybe but it's really on par with DTX prices for a decent meal.\n\nI think I'm going to stick with the U-Bowls and entrees from now on, but I'll be going back to UFood","date":"2009-05-19 17:08:14"}

Their breakfast tacos with chorizo are light on the chorizo and heavy on the eggs.

Probably both.  The last tortillas I got there had very dry, stale edges which is a pet peeve of mine.\n\nThat said, ordering a cochinita pibil, a tomatillo pork, and a glass of sangria is a cheap, tasty, and effective hangover-helper... so props to El Chilito for that.","date":"2008-12-03 17:13:11"}

Remove that segment Disney, and you'll be doing fine in my \"book\".","date":"2013-12-28 20:48:45"}

I was originally going to the Boylston St location but switched to the High St location for convenience. Therapists at this location are incredibly knowledgeable. The staff here consists of mostly male therapists, except for my therapist Lisa (And Kelsey? Who might only be there part time not sure). I actually prefer a more male dominant clinic, as I find that the atmosphere can be more relaxed while still keeping a professional tone.\n\nI work as a professional ballroom dancer and came in for two injuries (knee and shoulder). Lisa has given me a program geared very specifically to my athletic ability. The skill sets and quality of physical therapists can range greatly. I've been to clinics where I've felt that I was not being challenged enough given the physical demands of my sport. Lisa has designed a program to optimize muscle rehabilitation with a concentration on exercises geared specifically to increase blood flow and nutrients to my knee and shoulder. \n\nAside from being a great therapist, I find that Lisa is able to give a genuine warmth and sense of concern for her patients.  While I've been to a number of very qualified male therapists, I find that they can sometimes lose their sense of human connection to the patient and I end up feeling like a cow in a factory line. \n\nIn Lisa I see a great ability to empathize with patients, often putting their needs before her own. No matter how busy she is, or how early or late the day she always greets me with a genuine smile and a welcoming tone. \n\nAlthough I find all the exercise technicians to be competent, I have found Kyle to be the most knowledgeable and personable. He, like Lisa has a genuine care and interests in the well being of patients and is always very confident in his delivery of information on exercises. \n\nEric acts as a mentor at the clinic, and has really been able to hone in on microscopic details in my rehabilitation that has helped to propel my recovery process. \n\nJess, the clinic manger runs the best clinic I have ever been to. The office, while small is neatly kept, towels are always new, rug always clean, and table always sanitized.

Also, they don't try to pile expensive accessories onto every purchase. \n\nI have found them honest and reasonable and they have had my positive regard for a long time. \n\nNo one is perfect...recently, I had a problem with how something was handled. Mark, who runs the store, treated me respectfully, listened to my issue and we reached an agreement with which I am pleased.","date":"2017-05-26 03:20:11"}

The food was delicious. The service was great. The waitress was nice. I came for a visit from Boston, MA on vacation and when I suddenly spotted Papi's, I immediately had to give it a try. I was impressed with the restaurant d√©cor, service, and food menu. I had the shredded chicken, yellow rice, plantains, black beans and salad the first time. Delicious. The second time, I stopped in before heading back to the airport and just got the appetizer sampler that came with stuffed fried potato, ham croquettes, and a beef empanada. Delicious. I was not disappointed both times I went. I came with two friends and we were all completely satisfied! I will come here again if I have the opportunity to.","date":"2017-06-06 18:56:35"}

If you are hungry but not enough to keel over and go from hunger, then you are not going to regret waiting for this place.\n\nYou are seated at something like a ramen bar and you'll probably be sharing a table with someone you don't know, but it's likely that's how it's like in Japan. Our friends advised us that their tamago ramen is their best and it was so good because the broth was not too salty and the ramen was al dente. You might be tempted to get the one with more cha siu (pork), but since their noodles are their best part, you can also order just noodles when you're done your original serving. It's worth saving room in your very hungry self from waiting all that time.","date":"2018-09-14 02:29:10"}

You can order 2 sushi rolls from a good selection for $8.95, and for 3 rolls I believe it's under $12.\n\nTheir service is something that this restaurant can do so much better.  There's typically only one server up front, and depending how busy it is - you could be waiting a while to get your food and check.\n\nOverall, not bad for a lunch spot.

I hardly ever leave a restaurant without thinking, \"I coulda made that better at home.\" But not here. It would take a lot to learn how to work spices, herbs & sauces like they do!

My fiance had requested an assortment of pink roses in vases, and spread all over the suite, and it was amazing and gorgeous and so special. We don't drink so our \"welcome treat' was those special size Diet Cokes in tin cans and chocolate covered strawberries. \n\nValet parking was complimentary with this level room, and as we were on the Club Level, there was a lovely room with tons of seating, small tables, arm chairs, and such with meals\/drinks\/snacks through the day at almost all hours. The breakfast might be called \"continental\" but it was only a hair \"less than\" the spread downstairs. The fluffiest eggs (my absolute fave are well done hotel spread eggs), a ton of perfect fruit, Irish oatmeal, a coffee machine that makes every drink you could want, breakfast burritos....I could keep going since I love breakfast food so much!\n\nThe hotel was BUZZING with the football folks, another big event going on in a large ballroom, I'm sure what was just early holiday traffic, and everyone we encountered was pleasant, helpful and just lovely.\n\nI loved everything about my fiance's idea that yesterday should be a \"trial run\" of sorts for our wedding NEXT December 1 and the InterContinental was a super place to choose for the royal treatment.","date":"2017-12-02 22:07:23"}

It's not worth it. Seriously, you would be better off finding a rando roommate of craigslist than you would living here. \n\nI lucked out and got pretty good roommates - this has not been true for many other people I have spoken with at this apartment complex. It's luck of the draw and the odds are not in your favor. A guy I know in the complex had a roommate threaten his life and the life of his dog, he had to tell management he was going to pursue legal action before they would move the man into another room. The replacement roommate didn't clean to the point where his room should've been declared a bio-hazard. Like seriously, the guy threw up all over the wall and floor then covered it with a blanket and went out of town for a week. \n\nThe main issue is if these people aren't your roommates, it means they're your neighbors. Mine are all people who barely know how to take care of themselves, let alone another living creature, but for some reason have all adopted puppies they're too immature to actually take care of. There's constantly dog feces everywhere, even on the stairs and cement walkways leading to your apartment. Sometimes, they just leave the dog outside, completely unsupervised even though complex policy is that they're required to be on a leash. I'm amazed none of the dogs have gotten hit by cars. \n\nThere's constantly garbage everywhere - there's was a pizza box with spaghetti in it that sat on the ground outside for 5 days. There's a tree off our balcony my neighbors like to throw trash into - at one point they were up to 3 pizza boxes, a pillow and a vodka bottle all stuck in this tree. The complex has people that come around and pick up some of it, but it's like they do the bare minimum and ignore the rest. \n\nBecause the neighbors are dirty and leave trash everywhere, there are constantly roach problems. No matter how much you clean or how many times you put in a work order for pest control (which frequently gets ignored) you will still have roaches. Forever. \n\nThey advertise \"gigabyte internet\" in every room, but it cuts out almost every week, so good luck with that. \n\nA significant problem is that the office only hires tenants so since the place is primarily occupied by idiot college students, the office is pretty much run by idiot college students. The few that actually try to do their job and aren't completely incompetent don't seem to have any power to actually accomplish anything and the rest are often either misinformed or flat out lying to you. My friend once had an issue with a staff member being incredibly rude to her so she tried to complain to someone - they told her to speak to the woman she needed to complain about. \n\nAll in all, this place in absolutely awful and you should not live here at all ever.","date":"2015-06-08 17:07:32"}

They do have gluten free crust options as well as thin crust, original, pan, stuffed, etc.  The pizza is deliciously fresh and you simply pop it in the oven and bake! Perfecto!  It is WAY better in quality then any of the other take out pizza places in town. This location is extremely generous with the toppings, so go crazy! I also like that they have \"gourmet\" toppings like artichoke hearts and kalamata olives.  They also have ready made salads that are great lunch options.  Everything's been delicious and they always hand out discounts and coupons to keep us coming back. Love it.","date":"2015-02-24 04:25:05"}

When the TV movie is made telling the story of Arthur T., I want to have a cameo as a customer.  :)\n\nUpdate 12\/21\/2013: Market Basket does not earn 100% marks because their new plastic carry bags are tissue paper thin although they look the same as the old ones.  When single-bagged, these new shopping bags are so thin, a soft styrofoam meat package can rub through it.  They cannot withstand pressure or rubbing.\n\nMarket Basket has no web site, no receipt survey, and does not actively seek customer feedback.  If Yancy-F-127 haphazardly crushes your eggs and makes a messy soup in the bottom of your shopping bag each time, while Aurelia-G-186 treats your eggs as carefully as if they are her own, the managers are not aware of who are their best, and who are their worst, cashiers.  The management is not in the loop to resolve ongoing problems quickly. \n\nOriginal:\n\nThis is the Boston metro area's last best chance for a \"everyday-low-price\" style supermarket.  Market Basket is super busy on the weekends and specially the night before a holiday weekend.  It is not the place you should expect the cashiers to ever know you by name.  It is busy.  It is high volume.\n\nFor people lacking time to shop weekly fliers for bargains, Market Basket will be easiest on your wallet when buying most assorted foods.  It is a place to find 25 pound bags of jasmine Asian rice.  The regular price of fresh produce will often beat the sales price of other grocery stores.  Frequent bargain announcements blasted over the store PA system gives the place some personality.\n\nShoppers who hate long lines may want to shop elsewhere regardless of higher costs.  However, if you visit Market Basket during bad weather in the middle of the week, long lines can be avoided.","date":"2012-05-28 20:14:29"}

A brief history is important.  When the restaurant first opened, it had a variety of reasonably priced comfort food items on the menu.  (My favorite was the salmon with bowtie pasta and vodka sauce.)  And it had a really nice wine by the glass list. And, it played soft selections of Sinatra and other pieces of the kind you hear on the \"Singers and Standards\" channel on the cable.  A little later, they built out the back into a patio, and successfully screened it from the Kroger loading dock next door so that it made for a delightful outside experience on summer nights. (That grocery store closed long ago, so no more problems there.)  It was a perfect spot for the Brookhaven\/Club neighborhood around it.  Then two bad things happened, and then a third.  First, the restaurant got too full of itself and it's wine selection, and kept upping the wine selection until a glass of wine was in the $18 to $25 range -- really a non-starter for a restaurant that by that time had seats in the booths that were beginning to fail.  Then they changed chefs (I presume) because the food quality went down.  And later, worst of all, they changed the music to loud, contemporary vocals, which I find extremely annoying during dinner.  \n\nSo I stayed away, for several years.  Having just returned -- twice now in the past couple of months, I was pleased with the new menu that contains a nice variety of dishes.  The several I have tried have all been good.  And, equally important, they brought the prices of the wines by the glass back down to a reasonable level.  The music on the inside was still too loud and annoying for my taste, but fortunately on the patio it was quieter and very pleasant.  Welcome back, Terra Terroir.","date":"2014-08-10 21:00:11"}

We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. \n\nSome of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise that's all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.\n\nThe ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue \"New England fishing scheme\" decor.\n\nBut we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didn't love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks\/conversation\/etc. exclusively to him (I'm female). And it didn't seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: we're here for the food. So....\n\nI love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if you're lucky). I'll certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.\n\nThe bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasn't fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, I've had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isn't a good sign that they know what they're doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and it's wasteful on the food costs. (We didn't really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)\n\nI love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more \"lobster pot pie\" than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.\n\nAs for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. \n\nWith the bisque being \"good,\" the salmon chowder being \"meh,\" the newberg being \"downright awful,\" and the roll being \"meh,\" nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there\/return\/be romantic\/eat more\/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere.

I tried so hard, considering the restaurant is literally 6 minutes from my house and thus my neighbor. I love Union Square and the refinement that Journeyman (purportedly) brings is definitely overdue. However... It just does not work. On paper, the restaurant is everything I love: local, modern, inventive, casual, but in reality, the restaurant seems to take itself too seriously. Despite the disappointing dining experience, I'm glad I went, I just won't be returning. \n\nThe hubs and I went to celebrate a wedding anniversary and opted for the five-course omnivore menu, added a serving of the foie gras, confit veal tongue and smoked beef heart. The five-course menu consisted of spring salad with favas, peas, spinach, carrots and had  \"spring foam\", that didn't seem to really serve a purpose; asparagus with soy and bonito; sous vide black cod with leek puree and potato; veal breast with sweetbreads and artichoke and a dessert of cane sugars, including macarons, shoofly pie and about twelve different things. As an amuse, we were offered a warm lentil salad, gruyere gougeres and house-cured ham. There was also a pre-dessert which was a flan with freshly grated nutmeg and post-dessert of poppyseed crackers with rhubarb jam and Florentines with house-made marshmallows. So all in all, we ended up having eleven different things to taste. If I were to order anything again, I'd ask for the cod and the sweetbreads, followed by the flan. Unfortunately, the rest just seemed discordant; the flavors weren't in harmony for me at all. Especially the asparagus dish was so bland, which was so surprising considering there were about 15 components on the plate! Each plate was pretty but the gels, foams and pearls can only get you so far when the flavors aren't up to \npar. \n\nThe drinks were wonderful, albeit tiny. For a $14 cocktail, I'd like more than 4oz. \n\nThe atmosphere was awkward to say the least. We did arrive on the early side, with a six o'clock reservation, but we immediately felt like intruders. There is no music, which automatically made us feel like we should whisper to each other. Space is so spare that some music would definitely compliment the industrial, even slightly clinical vibe. I just wanted the restaurant to feel fun and it is about much as fun as a hospital recovery room. \n\nThe service was... adorable. In the way that there is so much good-willed effort and so little actual success. I seriously thought that our server might explode with awkwardness. The stilted service made me giggly, which in turn seemed to worsen the awkwardness. Ah well. \nAll in all, our tab came to $270, which is kind of absurd, despite the fact that we had quite a few drinks - for half that, we could have had a much more substantial and meal at e.g. Island Creek Oyster bar, or Coppa. Not to mention we could have had a laugh.","date":"2011-05-27 16:56:24"}

I read online what to do to prepare and did such. When I went in the front desk staff were very friendly and the waiting room looked clean. I was called back a few minutes later by the waxer (I forget her name) I think Kelsey. Once we went into the room I got undressed and she started wiping. I thought she was going to go through the process with me as I told her this was my first wax. She abruptly stopped, explained to me she had other clients booked after me and then said rudely what are your questions. After asking she did the first strip of wax which hurt more than anything in life I have experienced! I said can you give me a minute before the next one? She stated again that she did not have time to give me a break because she had other clients. After the second strip I screamed and said I did not want to continue this it was far too painful. She said I've been doing this for over 10years, my response was I'm sure you have but this is not for me. She told me I could get dressed and as I pointed out the wax that was still left on my vagina and my skin was BLEEDING! She gave me a tissue and walked out of the room. I got dressed after placing tissue on my areas of skin that were still bleeding and left. Waxing is not for me I found it to be way too painful however this waxer was extremely unprofessional. She was blonde. She looked like she had been on an all night prior party bender with her makeup from the previous night still on. She had on scrubs that were completely wrinkled. Inside the exam room the floor was filthy, I know it is winter but clients are getting undressed the floor should be clean. Again had the experience been nice I could still say this wasn't for me but I'd refer a friend here, hell no. It was dirty, the waxer was dirty looking and her attitude was stank! Also there was NO one in the waiting room as I left!","date":"2018-02-01 19:06:40"}

Maybe because I'm still a kid at heart, but this place is COOL! \nYea the rooms are a little small, but for the price it definitely cannot be beat. \nDisney staff is so friendly and smiley and polite. They help you with any questions you have. The resort has THREE pools in funky shapes. Open pingpong table next to the pool. Tons of sunning chairs. Larger than life statues of classic favs from each decade; I stayed in one of the '60s buildings right next to the Hippy Dippy pool. The arcade inside the main building was jam packed, filled with  addictive games. And they give tickets that you can trade in for prizes. Free shuttle buses to ALL Disney parks + Downtown Disney makes life so much more convenient. and we got Magical Express for staying at a Disney resort aka a big bus picked us up from the airport, dropped us off at Pop, and our luggage was automatically delivered to our room for freeeeee.\n\nFood court has simple selections: burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. Overpriced, but not obscenely overpriced. The best part are the three stations for drink refills: basically unlimited soda, coffee, slurpees, hot chocolate if you have a Disney cup. \n\nThe notgreat part was the keycard demagnetization. It happened so often and it sucks. We would walk all the way back to our rooms to be denied access. Then have to walk back to the main building to get it remagnetized. At least the staff was quick and apologetic. Made us feel a little less annoyed of the situation.\nand I also kind of felt trapped inside Disney's world. Made it a challenge to get OUT of the Disney area without a car. We learned to catch Lynx buses at the ticket&transportation center.\n\nOverall, I super recommend Pop Century.

From the moment he greeted us it was like night and day from any other leasing agent we had dealt with over the last three months. It was very close to closing time and in fact I suspect during the tour of the property it was past time for him to go home. He never once referred to the time and we never got the impression he was trying to hurry it along. I even mentioned it being near closing time and he shrugged it off\n\nWhen we were done we explained to him we were determined to get a first floor two bedroom apartment with a yard and would be willing to wait for that to come available. I have had this similar conversation with other leasing agents and never heard back from them even after being assured  they will contact us when one came up. Gary took our information and made the same promise. Much to my surprise two weeks later I get an email from Gary informing us that he had found the two bedroom apartment with a yard. \n\nGary is a real standout and complete professional. He made the tour enjoyable and fun and followed up on his promise. I will also add that after the tour that day my wife and I were hanging out near the property talking when we saw Gary leaving.

The teachers seem to genuinely care about the students, as do the co-op advisors.  The academic advisors don't seem as concerned, but I also think it's due to their hectic schedules and the amount of students they need to worry about.  If I could do it all over again, I would!

Basically a much better website with streamlined choices.\n\n- I love how they have a recommended bin each week with the freshest produce for the week, and how much this changes from week to week to keep you constantly getting different items and keeping things interesting.\n\n- They are VERY good at only listing the produce and fruit that is actually available when you are ordering so no missing items and\/or substitutions.\n\n- They simplify their choices, so they don't offer 4 or 5 different kinds of apples for instance.  But each week they have 1 or 2 (and actually have them!).  \n\n- The quality of the produce has been on par or superior with that from Ladybug.  Been enjoying some of the sweetest carrots, creamiest sweet potatoes, non-bitter artichokes, delicious locally baked granola, crispy flavourful fuji apples, most flavour packed broccoli that I have had for a long time along with everything else.\n\n- I love that for things you order regularly you can establish a standing order and get a 5% discount (milk, eggs, etc.).\n\n- Their customer service is really on top of things.  They are very proactive and contact you quickly and efficiently.\n\nI hope this continues, and as long as it does I think it will be Green Earth going forward!

It had an odd taste to it -- not horrible but not great. I didn't finish it and I am not someone that leaves before I finish my drink.\n\nSeafood Fondue -- VERY CHEESY and the description didn't mention that it had tons of mushrooms in it. I am not a fan of mushrooms. The cheese on the top was good but the cheese that was mixed with the seafood (scallops, shrimp & crawfish) was very runny. Not like any other seafood fondue we have ever had before.\n\nKid's Cheeseburger -- the meat was very very dry. G said he preferred the school cafeteria's burger over what was on his plate. Frozen french fries were nothing special either.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Salmon & Stuffed Shrimp -- grilled shrimp was bland and took 3 lemon wedges to give it a touch of flavor; salmon was okay but nothing special; stuffed shrimp was good but had a touch too much Old Bay Seaoning on it.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Blackened Catfish & Stuffed Shrimp -- E says that his grilled shimp was like mine, he liked the stuffed shrimp and the catfish was okay.\n\nRed Beans & Rice (side dish) -- this did have good flavor and I enjoyed it\nSteamed Brocoli -- nothing exciting\n\nJalapeno Hushpuppies -- I am pretty sure that someone forgot the jalapenos. These hushpuppies were bland. When I order something that has jalapeno in it, I expect a kick to it and these did not deliver at all.\n\nWe don't plan on going back again. Not sure if they were having a bad night in the kitchen or what but we weren't impressed and the customer service was okay but not enough to make us want to try it again.","date":"2011-01-09 02:18:20"}

The bacon jam has kind of a sweetness that offset the bacon's salty side. Kind of a caramelized taste. The blue cheese was perfect with it. I decided to try the sweet potato salad as my side,  because I've never heard of it. It was really sweet and creamy. It was really tasty but not quite as chunky as I prefer for my potato salad.

I've always wanted to try authentic okonomiyaki and takoyaki and although I'm not sure how close it is to the real thing, my experience here was unique and I found it worth the visit. \n\nThe okonomiyaki was described as a cheesy savory seafood pancake and it was exactly that. It had a nice crisp on the outside and an incredibly soft and fluffy inside. The cheesy pockets were the best! It was more salty than I imagined and the sauce on top lacked the sweetness that I originally thought it would have. The pickled ginger was also unsweetened. It wasn't an unpleasant surprise though. The seafood gave it a nice variation of texture as well. I would highly recommend it! \n\nThe omu curry rice with the pork katsu was also very delicious. The katsu was the crispiest I've ever had and the curry was very homely. The omurice had a comforting light texture to it as well and everything tasted amazing when it was all put together! \n\nI also had the takoyaki and I'm happy to report that it tasted identical to the ones you can find all over Vancouver from the night market to random sushi places. \n\nAll in all, it was a neat little place to visit at least once. The staff are extremely friendly and they have the most adorable voices! The food was very comforting but there's nothing about it flavour wise that would blew me out of the water. However, it's one of the few places that serve okonomiyaki in Vancouver so it would still be worth a visit.","date":"2017-07-18 20:18:07"}

Odd doesn't mean bad. Just odd.\nI went in for a haircut today. The hairdresser was a no-nonsense looking older man, who did not even slightly appear to be gay, so my first thought, sexist as it may be, was \"Oh no, he's going to destroy my hair.\" But I decided to stay, anyway. I sat down in the shampoo chair, and the hairdresser dude proceeded to massage my scalp as he washed my hair. Like REALLY REALLY massage my scalp. I didn't know hair salons even did stuff like that. It wasn't bad, but I would have appreciated a heads-up. He should have said, \"Hey, I'm about to give you a vigorous scalp massage. Hold on to your britches.\" Instead, it was a surprise, so it was awkward.\nI showed him a picture of what I wanted. He cut my hair a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but that's not a huge deal as long as the layers line up correctly. I made the mistake of saying I like it curly-- cause I do, but most hairdressers think that means they can take a round brush and make you look like a juvenile beauty pageant contestant. I ended up stopping him halfway and saying, \"Hey, just run a blow dryer through it, I prefer my natural curls.\" So he did, and it looked fine. I'm lukewarm about the haircut for now, but it might look better in the morning once I wash it.","date":"2010-05-14 22:45:43"}

More food=more stars.  They would have gotten 4 from me had they stretched my meal with maybe another scoop of 2 or rice per dish.\n\nI had the etouffee and gumbo.  Each came with a small scoop of rice.  The liquid to-go containers were extremely nice.  They were large, tightly sealed plastic boxes that did not leak any of that Louisianian goodness.  That is probably the last time I will ever write a review about to-go packaging... but I was very impressed.\n\nThe crawfish etouffee was a little lighter than most.  It was a more tomato-y type sauce.  It was red, slightly tangy, and there was plenty of tender crawfish swimming around.  It was not as flavorful as some of the others I have had before, but it would have been a great pasta sauce or something.\n\nThe gumbo was a little runnier than I prefer.  It was plenty dark, but it lacked that rich flavor.  I classify it as a soup in my book, but it is definitely a flavorful soup.  There was a little too much sausage, as I prefer my gumbo ratio to lean heavier on the seafood side.  The chicken meat was extremely tender and tasty, though.  There was some tender shrimp mixed in also.\n\nCrazy Cajun offers solid Cajun food, but I would like a little bit more food and some zippier flavor.

We were curious to see what all the rave was about. We were greeted at the door by a cordial young lady and she told us the name of our waitress and that she would be right over. She approached our table within a minute or so and introduced herself. She was very kind and a great waitress. I just wish I remember her name. We went in about 6:30 PM and at that time there were only a few other parties inside eating. \n\nWe ordered our burgers and I must admit that they were all cooked to perfection. They were on the bland side and nothing to brag about. I don't think they were flame broiled on a nice hot live flame...... too bad for us. We ordered tots and they were so-so. The onion rings were very good and sliced nice and thin and yes, they were crunchy. Five had sodas and one had tea. \n\nAs we tried to carry on a conversation, it was difficult to do so. The music was extra loud and we could not hear one another talking. Three times we asked for them to please turn it down. We had planned on having a dessert and coffee afterward but we just wanted to hurry up and get out of there because the atmosphere was not pleasant. This restaurant is definitely not geared for the over forty crowd. The music was not the type any of us would listen to. It made for a tense meal. Three finished their burgers and three did not. As for the tots and fries, most of those were left behind too. We quickly asked the waitress for the bill so we could leave. Trust me, none of our meals looked like the pictures do up above. \n\nWe went around the corner to another establishment and had dessert and coffee there. The ambiance was nice and the dinner music was soothing. Ahhhhh, so relaxing..... finally. We carried on great conversation with a lot of laughs. The place was half filled at this time. \n\nHonestly, the Wahlburgers are way over their heads. They have opened up too many restaurants all over the country and out of the country. Paul and the family are not on site to see how things are being run by outsiders. Right from the beginning from watching the show, Paul was spot on when he made it known that he not happy with the expansion of Wahlburgers. He was afraid the quality would slide and go down.... it did. \n\nWithin a decade or less, I am sure you will see some of their franchises closing. When the owner is not around to watch the day to day operation, you lack the hands on approach as family is missing and that isn't good. More isn't always better and that rule applies to Wahlburgers. \n\nIf I need a burger, I am better off going to Five Guys in the next town... Peabody, Massachusetts. Better food and half the price. \n\nSorry guys, I didn't want to do this. Don't build anymore of these places as nobody from your family knows what is going on.","date":"2017-05-13 09:58:54"}

And then ordered a custom sandwich with a Hawaiian bun, cheddar, ham, an egg, spinach, and jalape√±o cream cilantro sauce. \n\nIt was tough for me to decide which one I liked better but I think I settled on the Croque-Madame. It was a little sweet but the flavors combines were amazing. \n\nOur custom sandwich wound up being really good too, mostly thanks to the sauce.

The Hawaiian bun stayed pretty toasted and crispy.*\n\nOur sides were a fruit cup and tomato soup (cute!). The fruit cup was green apples and oranges, refreshing and the fruit tasted fresh. The tomato soup was good. Had some chunks in it, probably tomatoes. So that was a strange consistency, but the taste was really good.

Also, there are certain soups and salads highlighted (and changed) each month.  For instance, in March, the theme is Latin flavors.  The bread options are abundant as well.

They brought the salad first,  which ended up delaying the main veggie platter especially long.  They even brought the check in between!

That said, the gluten content goes up.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the ambiance, which was large, hipster, and fun.  They're very busy with good reason, the food is delicious an affordably priced.

The two allowances for this rule are coffee and sushi. Fish Market has now snagged my \"Go to Sushi Spot\" award.\n\nI'd learned a valuable lesson years ago when I had gone to a restaurant for the first time and gotten rather mediocre food. I didn't go back for over a year even though it was right next to my apartment. I went back and BOOOOM best dinner of the year that night.\n\nThis is a reason I withhold my reviews until I've been to an establishment a minimum of 2 times. Being my 3rd time at Fish Market, I must say this place is a go to spot.\n\n1) It's tiny. To some this may mean a wait that they wish not to endure. For me this means no damn screaming college kids \"HEEY MORE SAHKIIII\". It also makes it feel more like a sushi bar and less of a japanese food trough service.\n\n2) I've gotten the same waittress every time. Although the first time dining at FM there was a confusion with my order, she remedied it swiftly and with a great attitude. She's always super sweet and attentive, even promoting their \"Free ice cream\" promo while my lady and I were discussing whether or not she wanted some ice cream.\n\n3) My sushi\/ meals here have so far been consitently great. I always get a \"clean\" fresh taste from my food here. It is what I now expect. If the sushi were priced higher, as it is at some restaurants, I would not hate it due to the great quality. I have yet to try the acclaimed Avocado ball, but everything from my Eel Handroll to the Chirashi and Sushi Deluxe have been amazing.\n\n4) Price is great. It's also why I do not fear leaving great tips. $5 tip on a $15 should ont be considered exemplary but it seems it is by current standards. Either way, don't hate when I get my food before you.","date":"2013-02-21 21:57:50"}

Val has been on her game in the Couve for about 2.5 years now, after refining her most sacred shao-lin technique with her hot pots, in downtown Portland \"for about 15-16 years.\"\n\nDeserving special mention from the menu were the triple-decker Ruebenator, and the philly cheese-steak scramble. So much tender, juicy meat! I'd drive out of my way out to the Couve, to order either of these entrees again.\n\n\nThe one glaring omission in Val's business model is the lack of accessibility. She's only open a few hours a day. True, she's built a booming business with legions of adoring fans and in all likelihood simply doesn't need to hire more staff to stay open later. The problem being, there's a vast cross-section of potential and acutal fans of Val's that work swing or graves that are largely, effectively cut off from having access, and this little diner is a place that deserves plenty of exposure to the masses. Should Val ever consider  later hours (esp on weekned nights), that'll be just the bump needed for instant 5 star accolades.

They were out already (of course), but gave me a \"Firearms Request Form\" and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock.  A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks.\n\nTwo weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabela's.  So I start a series of polite calls to the store.  And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with \"Jay\", who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00.  After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s).  \n\nNeedless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call.  Apparently once I left the store with that \"Firearms Request Form\", my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela's trash can.  Or so I surmise, because Cabela's REALLY didn't seem to want my $370.  Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess.  So I took my business to one of Cabela's local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didn't have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela's.\n\nI do hope someone at Cabela's sees this review, and finds out why a customer can't receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all.  Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back.  Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabela's, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service.  Going forward I think I'll take a pass on Cabela's.  And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabela's you may or may not get it.

The restaurant was hopping, with a short wait for a table. But the tap room downstairs had plenty of seating, and quick dual-bartender service. Some nice things to note about the tap room: 1) you can enter from the back of the restaurant where most people park, 2) if you are a smoker you can pop in and out, 3) there is plenty of bench seating for large groups, 4) this floor has it's own restrooms (clean ones), 5) you can request a table for dinner, and then hang out in the tap room until the table is available. It got a little noisy in there, but only after they started to fill up. The room is really large, and had nice lighting (and clean tables).\n\nThe drinks weren't too bad. It was a strange selection for as many beers as they had. I am an IPA fan myself, but with the 20 some beers on tap, there was one IPA, and one Imperial IPA. I did a beer flight of 5 beers for $12.50. I have had cheaper flights! When I couldn't decide on a fifth beer I asked the bartender to give me a wildcard and surprise me and she gave me a \"Bucharaht\" (sp?). To me, it tasted a bit like bacon. I passed it around the table, and everyone agreed it had a nice smoked flavor. I ended up having to order a full beer of it.\n\nThe bartender was not the friendliest I have ever had, hence not a five star in my book. You expect a little more personality, I guess. But I got beer, relatively fast, and was able to cash out after every order (not knowing how long we would stay).\n\nI noticed parking was a pain. We were staying in town and went on foot.

Our wait wasn't more than 10 minutes at the cocktail tables outside the tent that defines the restaurant, then we were seated next to a nice family with cute kids. Everyone sits at picnic tables and unless you have a large group, plan on sharing your table.\n\nStarters were the crab cakes and drunken shrimp (it doesn't need the chips) -- perfect with the Fisherman's Brew from Glouchester on draft. My dining companion and I split a two pound lobster that was scrumptious. For obvious reasons, you don't get relatively inexpensive lobster on the West Coast, so this was a treat.","date":"2015-08-19 04:18:07"}

That sandwich is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It's got a chipotle mayo that is just incredible. It's been about 3 years since I've been here but I still crave that meatloaf sandwich all of the time. I did have the Mac and cheese at one point and from what I remember, that was great too.

We waited in line (in the rain) for 1.5-2 hours for each haunted house, and each house takes about 3-4 minutes to walk through (not the greatest wait-time to ride-time ratio) . Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line, which really ruins the surprise element of the scares. We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised, so we weren't scared or surprised in the least.\n\nUniversal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN. Even on a stormy night, the lines were ridiculously long, and we only got to experience a fraction of the houses due to the wait times.\n\nUnless you are a season pass holder with early access or fork over extra cash for the express pass, I wouldn't recommend attending. Don't waste a chunk of your night waiting in line for sub-par haunted houses.","date":"2012-10-08 14:41:32"}

Just don't really eat pancakes and all that stuff, and they do a nice job with two eggs, but it's not exactly something I would get crazy enough to write a review about.\nThen I needed a last minute place for dinner. They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....\n\nThey had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. \n\nThen, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. \n\nWhen I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. \n\nUnlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food. I like that I can get in without making a reservation a week in advance, like some other spots on Tremont. I'll definitely be back at this excellent neighborhood cafe.","date":"2016-08-04 01:26:49"}

I wish they'd asked us in what order we wanted the plates. Instead, we got the hot dishes first and then the sushi a few minutes later.  \nLastly, we could not even eat the tiramisu.  Both my daughter and I found it had a strange taste, kind of a chemical taste. It did not look like a Tiramisu either (and I don't blame them, after all, this is not an Italian restaurant), more like a sad little (previously) frozen thing.   \nOverall, the food was good, but next time, if I go back, I'll make sure to ask to get my sushi first, and ask for water without ice cubes (hopefully it will take care of that bad taste.)","date":"2018-04-04 03:07:40"}

One of the corners is right next to a crowded doorway. Not only do you have to be mindful of people, the door itself is in the way. You essentially can't shoot from that corner of the table. An easy fix would be to take that door off entirely and just have an open doorway. \nSecondly, the drinks are pretty watered down. I've ordered a drink at the bar on a weekend and with dinner on a weekday (the sliders are pretty good). Despite the bartender being incredibly friendly during dinner, I was questioning if there was even alcohol in my cocktail (maybe I'm just an alcoholic). While there's no cover at this new location, you'll probably end up spending more on drinks and parking. \nI am impressed that this has remained an actual lesbian bar though.

Who the hell is he to determine how we feel about the rude and ignorant way we have been served and treated?  His \"great\" service does not make ours any less authentic or real.   The nerve of him  to even suggest otherwise. Even have the audacity to think that someone is insecure and have personal issues because the wait staff was extremely disrespectful. No, it's not their fault it's everyone else's. Yeah right!   Not everyone is going to have the same experience and the staff should treat all its patrons with respect, courtesy, and kindness. I have been in a LOT of places of all walks of life and I very rarely experience this kind of ignorance!  Your experience is yours and our experience is ours and we rate honestly and accordingly!!  Point, Blank, and Period.  If Costello's do not want bad reviews then they NEED TO HAVE A TALK with their staff.  That is what good business people do!! I guess we should suck up the disrespectful treatment because the waitstaff is having a bad day?  Are you fkn kidding me?

So I decide to check it out last night because they had a live band. I am giving this place one star due to the horrible attitude of the female bartender.  I am talking MAJOR attitude.  If you don't like your job  dealing with the public then find another line of work.  Her disrespectful tone and pinched up face was extremely disturbing to Me.  I won't ever go into that place again because of her for if she talked to Me and treated Me like that again she would see My ugly side.  The male bartender was much more friendlier!   If I ever go in there again it will not be on a day when she's working.  Very disrespectful.  You don't disrespect and give attitude to the f**&n customers and expect tips!! \n\nI ended up leaving there and going to Coco's Lounge. The hospitality shown at CoCo's lounge by the owner was exceptional.  Very friendly.  The waitresses had a smile, spoke to you with respect, and the service was fast!  The patrons were nice and the latin music was good.  Much better experience  I must say.  When I go somewhere and I am spending My money I expect to be treated with respect by the staff persons and not spoken to with attitude! \n\nPeriod!!\n\nIf anyone knows the owner\/s of Costello's PLEASE let Me know via email.  I am pretty offended by this bartender and I hope she isn't a relation.  They need better staff.

It was busy so hostess suggested seats at the bar.  Drinks came pretty quickly, but ordering took a while for a waiter to come back.  The food came aok, but then things went downhill.  It took forever to get a check as we couldn't get any of the bartenders' attention (and my friend had to get home to her child)  We finally got a check and it was 120 - umm, not our check. So then we had to wait to try to get someone's attention. Then we got our check.  But no one coming back to take payment. I finally got up, walked to the other side of the  bar, and got a bartender's attention to take my payment. I explained all these delays and he apologized and said he would review with staff (we told hostess too), but no offer of comping bill, or credit for future or anything and now the parking cost more in the lot because it took forever to get out of there - I think it was after 10p at this point!  My friend and I were exhausted and annoyed.  If you are going to seat people at the bar, you need to have normal service, and bring the right check, and collect payment so people can get out.  And then when we tell you it's a disaster, you should try to make good in some fashion.  Sorry really isn't enough when you've ruined our evening.

It lacked flavor and had no real kick but maybe that's because I'm into ethnic, exotic foods.  The wine was delicious.  The only thing I really remember is the dessert which was a creme brulee.

First, be very careful to review the \"professional design\" they put together for you.  We had 24\" sections that the salesperson filled with 21\" cabinets and a 3\" spacer which look VERY odd.  In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don't look quite right.  instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact.  And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions.  The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible.\n\nSecond, they do not call back.  If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will.  It will be a one-way street of communication.  Guaranteed.  I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening.  Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work.  Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise.  Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it.  Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. \n\nYou are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box.  You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc.  Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week?  6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews.  The cabinets are nice, but the price is not lower than other options.  Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around, not a cheaper option.  We are happy with our kitchen, but it was painful.","date":"2017-03-03 18:31:34"}

The eggs were a tad over poached for my liking; the yolk was barely runny. But as a whole the dish worked perfectly.

I was contacted by Chuck, the owner of Steel, after seeing my comments following a visit with a college pal. (You might peruse that previous review first for context.)\n\nWe had a lengthy phone conversation, specifically about White Tuna - which is an endangered species and, as you'll read in my previous review, was an offending dish during our visit. Chuck invited me back for an on-the-house meal, and I got to spend time with an incredibly dedicated restaurant owner who is committed to this city and excellence in foodieism. (On the day I visited, he had accepted the award from Creative Loafing for the city's best sushi.)\n\nThe Lobster Roll, which is one I had during my return visit, is a must. We had a smattering of other tasty nibbles, including the spicy tuna (great) - but the lobster roll was most certainly the stand-out.\n\nChuck also connected me with a source in New Orleans to interview for a blog post. So, not only was I re-enchanted with a local restaurant I had previously loved - I made a new friend in the process. Support this joint, because Steel opened and survived during the 2008 downturn and is still one of the nicest eating environments in midtown.","date":"2013-12-07 13:51:18"}

I had the Media Noche sandwich, a Cuban with ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Melt in your mouth scrumptious and overall fantastic flavor. I couldn't get enough. The mustard is pretty strong so be mindful if this isn't your thing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the other dishes, but our party also ordered empanadas which received only positive feedback and the Polla A La Brasa (White), chicken with herbs.

I usually find parking around Allston pretty easily on the streets or in the lot behind the liquor store. It's much more convenient for me than trekking to Chinatown or Dorchester for pho, and there are so many tables, I've never had to wait in line.\n\nTheir portions are quite generous and for under $10, you get a pretty tasty meal. For the pho, I always ask to get my eyeround beef raw on a separate plate rather than in the soup so that I can cook it myself, and it's awesome. I've done this over 20 times and have never gotten sick, so I do trust their meat. \n\nTheir bun (vermicelli) dish is my favorite and I love the ones with meat and crispy rolls. There's lots of veggies on it and I devour the whole dish soaked with fish sauce. \n\nTheir pork chops and catfish are both very good as well. The only bummer is that over the years, it seems they've started to skimp on the shrimp and pork spring rolls which I used to love. Since the portions are so big, I've stopped getting appetizers, although the shrimp toast and the quail were both tasty when I used to get them.\n\nThe shakes take a while and aren't better than nearby competitors, so I usually stick with the coconut juice which they put baby coconut in.\n\nI generally go every few months and during the winter, maybe every few weeks. (On a side note, after visiting Vietnam and having pho there, I actually enjoy the pho here better for the flavor and generous toppings.) Don't expect it to be mindblowing. I just really enjoy how consistent, simple, and good it always is.","date":"2015-02-02 07:42:16"}

We decided to stop in for brunch on a Saturday because it looked like our kind of spot and because it didn't seem too busy. Overall, the food was good, the drinks we very good, and the service was just OK. \n\nI'm a big fan of a good bloody mary, so I decided to go with the $4 bloody mary special they were having. Great drink. It tasted very fresh and like they spiced it themselves (rather than using some kind of purchased mix). You could see the fresh black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (which added a nice heat) floating in the drink. This was probably my favorite part of the experience. \n\nMy wife got the local beer flight, but they were out of a couple of beers, so they substituted others that were not local. No prob here: all of the beers were good. They have a decent selection of beers to choose from, too. \n\nFor my meal, I got the cobb salad, which was good. It was a nicely dressed salad topped with grilled chicken, fresh avocado, hardboiled egg, bacon, and feta cheese. I enjoyed it. My wife got the tacos, which she liked. \n\nAll in all, I would have gone with 4*, but the service was a little rough. Our waitress unexpectedly changed in the middle of our service (no one told us; a new person just started coming over to ask if we needed anything), and it was difficult to get the check at the end of the meal. I asked our new server, who forgot, and then I asked the hostess, who had to go ask our server again. Not a disaster, but not really smooth either. \n\nI would definitely give the Ale House another try if I came back to Austin.","date":"2014-05-25 22:55:41"}

This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.","date":"2016-04-11 19:58:31"}

After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch.  There were six of us celebrating a birthday.  \n\nIt started with a less than friendly greeting at the front door.  Our waitress was unfriendly, lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in.  That's right, we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order.  She didn't offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer.\n\nWhen our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything.  We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order.  She looked up and said, \"oh, yeah, you wanted sticky buns.  I'm looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out.\"   I said, \"well, that's unfortunate, because you had them when we came in.  Do you think you can check?\"  She said, \"I'll see if we might have one In the back.  Are you ready to order?\"  We all looked at each other and thought, oh my god...are we being punked?\n\nWe ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split.  Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience.  We ordered our food and it came out quickly.\n\nWe ordered the prawns and polenta.  The prawns were okay but we're not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor. The polenta could have used some salt, cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop.  The corn beef hash was over spiced (it tasted like a bottle of Mrs. Dash fell into the pan).  The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced.  The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp.  The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato souffl√© (it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut). It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top, less than a teaspoon.  The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned. \n\nWhen the waitress finally came over to check in on us, our drinks empty, she rattled off quickly, \"everything good, everybody love everything? I looked at her like are you kidding me, \"No.  Can you tell me what's on top of this waffle?  Is it some kind of whipped cream?\" Her response was, \"It's a sweet potato souffl√©, I can get you whipped cream.\"  I looked at her and said no thank you.  She walked away, didn't ask if she could get me anything else and didn't ask if we would like anything else to drink.\n\nThe food can be improved upon, bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not.  Taste your food before going out and dedicate some time to training your people to give an experience.  I for one would rather drive downtown for better food, great service and an experience I'm willing to tell my friends about. \n\nThis unfortunately, will not be a place I would recommend.","date":"2014-11-30 01:49:11"}

Bob was there early and with no hesitation, let me in and had it up on the stand right away.  He called me before 10am with the prognosis and I was able to pick up my bike and cycle home that night.

We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations, decided to sit at a table. Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps. The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types. We asked if we could get items off the 'cafe' menu and he didn't know and then informed us the kitchen said no. He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant! I personally have been a server for the last 15 years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy.

We used them twice for one move. First to put some of our stuff in storage while staging our home and then for the final move a couple months later. The move went relatively smoothly but there were definitely some issues. First, they sent someone out ahead of the move so they could give us an estimate and make sure they had enough truck space. Even with that, they underestimated and there was stuff we had to put in our own vehicles and friends vehicles to transport ourselves AND we had to come all the way back to pick up even more stuff that didn't fit on the trucks. Second, we called ahead of time to discuss moving our Yamaha upright piano. They assured me they could do it, they do it ALL the time. There would be an additional charge of $200. $100 for each set of stairs. It took 4 of them over 30 mins to get it down the first set of stairs, it was so hard to watch I left the room. Then when we got to the new home, they got trapped on the first set of stairs, losing control of it and it ended up falling into the wall and putting a big dent and hole in it. We were calm and cool about it, even though this was a brand new home, and asked if THEY were all okay. Telling them, their safety and well being was our first concern, it's just a wall, etc. They were all white as ghosts and did not look confident at all about getting it up the stairs the rest of the way. We then we told them to just bring it down and move on to emptying the rest of the truck, they look relieved. We haven't even had the piano checked yet, so who knows what that adventure did to the piano. Third, when trying to navigate the treadmill to the second floor, they again got trapped at the first landing. The treadmill had to be lifted over a railing and turned but they had their shortest guy at the front and he just couldn't lift it high enough. On the last attempt, they lost control again and my husband had to help. He ended up having his end of the treadmill fall on his shoulder b\/c he was trying to stop it from hitting the head of the smaller crew member. Once the move was finally over, the damage that was done to the house during the move was written on the receipt by the crew boss and this is where our experience turned from okay to crap. When we called first thing Monday morning, we were told that we had to send a certified letter explaining the damages. We asked why would we have to send something in writing explaining it when you're looking at what your crew boss wrote on the receipt. They told us they would have their drywall guy call us, he's the best and he does this kind of repair all the time. That never happened. We called back and have emailed several times but to no avail. A lot of, \"well, let me reach out to him and have him touch base with you.\" They're great at lip service. We ultimately sent that certified letter, got a return receipt and still, it's been 8 weeks since the move and we haven't heard from anyone. So, while they can move heavy items, SOME heavy items, from point A to point B, God forbid there is a problem. They do not make solving the problem as much of a priority as getting the business.","date":"2018-07-26 15:42:00"}

I needed a black sweater for work and I live right down the street from this location so i made a quick trip there to get one. I walk in the store and after a few minutes I was greeted by a male employee that was very friendly. I find a sweater I liked and go back to the fitting rooms to try it on. No one was back there so after a minute or two I let myself in one of the rooms. Once I am ready to check out, I go to registers up front. No one was up there either so I wait. A redhead girl walks up after a few minutes and says nothing to me, just grabs the sweater from the counter and starts ringing it up. I mention to her that I had an email for a free nail polish with purchase. She asks to see it so I pull it up on my phone to show her. She looked at it and then says \"i'll be right back\". I wait longer for her to come back up to the front and finish ringing me up. She finally comes back up and hands me a sheet up paper with nail polish names on it and says those are the ones I could get. I pick about 10 up to see if the names on the bottom match the names on the list while she stands there and watches me. After I found none that actually were on the list I asked if they even had any of the ones that were offered in the promotion. She said, \"I think we have the space blue\". (After I had looked at all of them!!!) I give up on the nail polish and say never mind. No apology or anything from her. She just continues to ring up my sweater and after that whole ordeal and her rude attitude, I decide that there is no way in hell I am about to pay $70 for a generic black sweater I could get anywhere else. I told her I no longer wanted it and I walked out. I was willing to pay the price for convince just because I wanted it immediately, but she completely pissed me off and ruined my experience. I won't be going back any time soon.","date":"2013-11-14 05:32:28"}

This isn't really a fault as much as a marketing success for Hopdoddy, but considering it increases the time that separates me and a juicy hot meat patty I have to consider it a negative. Also you can't really have groups come eat here, I'd consider 4 a comfortable max, otherwise your chances of getting split up increase by a lot and how are you going to explain \"bros before hoes\" to your wife before you ditch the bitch?\n\nOnce you finally get through customs though and place your order get ready for the best burger high of your life. I recommend the shroom burger exclusively, unless they happen to have an appetizing burger of the week. \nThe shroom burger comes specially with pesto, portabella mushrooms, and goat cheese layered on a brioche bun. The buns are soft and buttery, perfectly baked in house. In a bite, the bun holds the package together well until you get to the real meat of the sandwich. Thick rich meat juice runs across your tongue as your salivary glands ejaculate in excitement, swathed in the creaminess of goat cheese. The nuttiness of the pesto accentuates the patty well, and the herbiness of the garlic gives a gentle bite that makes your spine shiver in anticipation of the next bite. Last but not least, the mushrooms add a good texture for a layered mouthfeel, their mellow earthiness blends well with the meat for a further enriched taste that will have you gnashing away at your burger like a crack addict looking for that next hit. Before you know it, the crack is gone and you're left staring at your tray wondering if it really happened. \n\nIf you happened to have fasted that day and are a sweet-tooth, the milkshakes are worth the splurge. Despite the fact the nutella & pretzel shake is often poorly mixed, this just means you have a salty ball of chilled hazelnut chocolate waiting at the bottom of your shake, the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.\n\nThe fries are pretty good, but not a main attraction by any stretch of the imagination. Overall - if you're feeling like you make enough money to justify spending this much on a nice patty hit Hopdoddy up. If you're on a budget go to \nP. TERRY's for the same quality but much cheaper.","date":"2015-02-02 05:56:38"}

The employees hustled about in perfect harmony, they greeted each customer with a smile, and thanked me after I was given my order.

All I know is that I tried the lamb gyro and it was very tasty.  It was a bit small for the price ($9 with some greens that I ended up stuffing into it because it looked bare otherwise).  However, the owner (I think it was her) was super nice and out of nowhere walked up to me and the other gentleman who was there working on his laptop and handed us some \"bagnye\" or something like that.  Basically it was deep-fried sweet balls over honey drizzle, sprinkled with cinnamon.  These were really good.  Granted, I love honey and cinnamon; I could DRINK this mixture all day.  The consistency was just right.  I guess I got on her good side by complimenting the dessert so much that a few minutes later she walked out with another serving.  At this point I hadn't even touched my gyro but soon found myself well on my way to devouring the 2nd complimentary plate of bagnyes.  \n\nThe bread on the gyro was spongy and the meat was flavorful and tender.

I was instantly in love since their front-of-store display included my three guiltiest pleasures in the world: scarves, hats, and tall boots. \n\nMy initial (and only, thus far) visit revealed a whole new time and money-sink for me. Scarves, large earrings, an impressive array of boots (most of which I l love, all of which are non-leather), a small but cute selection of clothing, large wooden bangles.. pretty much everything I love to wear condensed into one modest store (minus the overly shiny rings and pendants), and priced so that even your average gear-hording mountaineer can afford to retire her current pair of boots with the half-detached left sole. \n\nTo top it off, the store is staffed by some of the most helpful, cheerful, but unobtrusive and non-pushy employees ever. \n\nAs others have said, the quality isn't top-notch, but since my episodes of masquerading as an actual female are few and far between - it's good enough for me!","date":"2010-10-05 21:52:49"}

When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  \n\nPros:\nThe food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).\n\nCons:\nThe draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.  \n\n\nThe interior\/ambiance of the restaurant leaves something to be desired but if you are looking for really good Italian food, visit Andiamo and you will not be disappointed!","date":"2014-02-05 18:21:56"}

Wonton shell and spicy mayo\/avocado with a little lime was a nice combo. Just NO SEASONING and lacked flavor. I was dying just for a little touch of ponzu or something just to bring everything together.\n\nNative Lobster roll - Great lobster with generous portions. Brioche roll was nice. Again, a lack of SEASONING and just a bit bland\n\nShaved Prime Steak Sandwich- Nice quality prime rib shavings. Horseradish sauce is more creamy and very mild. Its juicy so it soaks up in the bread. Again, a bit bland like everything else. I noticed their picture puts gravy on the side but I think mine was pour over the sandwich. \n\nFritas- Though I complain that everything was under salted and I thought this was OVER salted than most fries. Otherwise, a good lunch frita. Individual ketchup, pretty cool\n\nVerdict 2 stars: I wouldn't be so picky if the prices weren't SO HIGH. Maybe the public has a blander palate but I think this is basic execution to properly season dishes.

For years, the guys at April Realty\/Aero Lawn Maintenance have occasionally mowed and trimmed my yard, a huge 7 acre mini-ranch in south Austin.  Even though they mow it infrequently, I'm always amazed that they remember from year to year all the little details. They do an excellent job, show up on time,  are friendly and courteous, and charge a fair price.  I can only afford to have them do it 3 or 4 times a year and I do the rest.   \n\nWhile they were mowing my yard a few weeks ago, a member of the crew accidentally hit my Toyota truck and put a fair-sized dent in the left front fender.  I didn't see him do it, and without an eyewitness I thought,  'Oh crap, this won't turn out well'. \n\nNervously, I called the owner, fearing that I might encounter the sort of denial and resistance we all run into all too often these days.  But what I got instead was what we all would like to find in such a situation: accountability.\n\nThe owner never hesitated to take responsibility.  His name is David, and I've met him a few times over the years.  And the way he handled what happened is the way every business owner should handle such situations.\n\nThe next day, I received a call from his insurance company, two days later an adjustor came out,  and within a week, I received a check for the damage.\n\nThat's how things are supposed to work.  That's called integrity, honesty, serving the customer.  And even though it's a little thing, it's the sort of thing that helps, even slightly, to restore your faith in people.

Crew was incredibly unprofessional.  Yelling, screaming and swearing at one another (especially the large woman in the purple shirt who I assume is the manager)  It was intimidating and horrible as the woman even yelled out the \"F-word\" right in front of us and I had two children with me that are ages 3 and 6.  In addition, the crew was super rude right tin front of the customers.  Chatting about inappropriate things among themselves, talking on the phone, eating in the front end register area, etc... All the while the restaurant and restrooms are filthy dirty and customers are literally being ignored.  This is not the first bad experience I had here.  Last time, it was the same scenario with the total lack of professionalism AND a young employee had gone outside to smoke a cigarette right in front of ht front door of the restaurant resting alongside the fence to the kid's playground where my children were playing!  I know it's McDonald's and not meant to be fine-dining in a 5 start restaurant or anything like that... but this level of disgusting behavior can not be tolerated.

If I'm Downtown during dinnertime or lunchtime, you'll most likely find me at Samurai.\n\nThe food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!\n\nThe service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before.\n\nI would most definitely recommend Samurai.

I just want to preface this by saying:\n I've been here several times for Dim Sum (say, 5-6) and once for regular dinner service. I know it's pricey for Dim Sum. \n\nDinner was great. It was a long time ago.. I don't remember what we got exactly but it was delicious and beautifully presented. A bit more than what you'd normally pay at a regular Chinese joint, but the hike in price was more than represented in quality of food.\n\nDim Sum the next several times was lovely. A little more expensive than usual, but the exceptional Shanghai dumplings made up for it. My boyfriend and I could still be stuffed for ~$35 (including a bloody mary or two)... This time the bill was over $50 and we definitely weren't nearly  so stuffed..\n\nThe last time however, something was wrong. I could hardly enjoy the food as each time we selected something from a cart and our card was marked, we were rather suspicious that we were being charged incorrectly. We got 6 dishes, and 3 of them were absolutely marked incorrectly. One was off-menu but 2 little steamed chicken buns should not be a L when comparable items (all other steam buns or chicken buns) were S or M priced dishes..\n\nThe one that really got our goat was being charged the 'Special' price ($7.95) for the pork shanghai dumplings (should have just been the XL price).. We've eaten 2 orders of these every time we've been here and have tried the ones with crab (don't like 'em as much) and these were most definitely JUST pork...\n\nSo yeah. $8 for 3 little dumplings. That's insane. A fourth item (shrimp won tons) was off-menu  as well and we were charged for an XL when comparable items were priced lower. $8 for 2 fried shrimp pockets. They were fantastically delicious, but damn. Not $8 worth of delicious.\n\nI generally don't hesitate to bring the bill to someone and question things if need be, but damn I just didn't feel like it.. I was just so disappointed that I was feeling potentially taken advantage of by this caliber of place that I have enjoyed so much in the past. I felt totally dejected and betrayed. \n\nI should NOT have to worry about paying the \"Stupid Tax\" here. You know, when you notice there's a random $2.95 charge on your bill and when you ask someone about it they don't even investigate, they just go \"Oh I'm so sorry! I'll take it off!\". .That's the stupid tax. If you've never noticed it on a bill before, you've probably paid it a few times. I'm generally on the lookout for it, but places definitely gain my trust and I let my guard down.\n\nI've eaten Dim Sum  at many other places where there was no price listing to look at, and there wasn't a single English word on the little tally sheets, and I've never felt cheated before. If they've changed priced, they need to fucking make note of that on the item\/price listings they leave on your table. I hope they're not just trying to take advantage of people's ignorance and hesitance to ask questions when they're sliding food onto your table if you so much as glance at it. That's how dim sum works but if you're not expecting it, it can be intimidating to say \"no, no!\" to get things you don't want taken off your table.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars in deference to the previous lovely times I've had here, and due to the possibility that 3-4 separate servers made mistakes and\/or they changed their prices and failed to mark them anywhere. If the latter is the case, that's just bad form in itself regardless, and this place is officially disproportionately priced. \n\nWow, this got long. I'm analyzing it like a breakup or something. Sort of feels like one..","date":"2008-12-04 03:50:22"}

I asked what made the Saudi coffee different from their brewed coffee, and they mentioned it had to do with the spices and cardamom.  Then they started talking about the Fresh Mint Lemonade.  I had to let one customer order before me just so I could decide.  I decided to get the Fresh Mint Lemonade and an Iced Coffee.  The coffee was great and so was the Fresh Mint Lemonade.

Within 1 minute of being in Rachel's arms, he relaxed and began to purr and in less than an hour he was looking fabulous and had been shaved, nails cut, ears cleaned and been looked over from ears to tail. Rachel did a fabulous job and made sure he looked and smelled his best while still being comfortable.

Meanwhile, our biggest meal up to that point on that special first day in Portland was taking individual bites of four yeast-raised monstrosities at Voodoo Doughnuts, so it would be appropriate to describe Jamie W. and me as feeling peckish anticipating our upcoming green papaya salad. When we passed by this trendy yet spacious shop, we were naturally intrigued. There was a polar bear in a ski cap and ice cream pop art on the wall (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ujpQ7l).\n\nThey had chocolate and vanilla, but of course, it had to be Valrhona Chocolate and Madagascar Vanilla. What was more intriguing to us were the two non-dairy froyo options that were apparently made from almond milk. Something sweet before dinner couldn't hurt, right? Jamie went for the Hazelnut Praline which for a small $3.95 cup, was a generously tall serving (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2KKa1BF). That meant I had to get a small cup of the Vanilla Latte which plopped over in pure exhaustion from the spigot (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2KVvBTc). Refreshing and not too sweet. It was the perfect unintended appetizer on such an eventful Portland day.\n\nFROYO - 4 stars...smooth dairy-free froyo worth seeking out\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...stylish spot that manages to be kid-friendly \nSERVICE - 4 stars...she was generous with the spigots\nTOTAL - 4 stars...froyo appetizers make sense to me","date":"2018-07-07 21:05:06"}

I had the blueberry pancakes and they were amazing--flavorful and buttery with crispy edges. The bacon and coffee were incredible, too. My only critique (and it's super minor!): the sugar bowl is fully stocked with artificial sweeteners and only 2 sugars. Our table asked for more sugar and was given another bowl with the same setup. Strange ratio. Also, with such high quality coffee, I was surprised not to see liquid sugar on the table. \nDinner: We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess. A sweet and personable waitress took our drink order. But then we had another waitress--who was a tad intense. Our group had pizza and burgers and were all happy with our choices. Our waitress forgot about us after a male friend of hers came in to visit. It was odd--she stood a few feet from us, but was too engrossed in her conversation to notice we were done with our meals.

Also, they have their slices (cut into squares) openly displayed and a whole gelato section that lulls a visitor into taking a seat, and wanting to sample their offerings.\n\nOver the past year, I've had food from here on four occasions. The first was a catered lunch at our company and the food was very solid (especially the \"Bocce Balls\").\n\nNow let's break it down further. On my subsequent trips, I've tried three different slices, and on my final trip, ordered some \"homemade\" pasta to go. Sad to say, the food has been maddeningly inconsistent. The pizza has never been bad, but then again, it is nothing to get excited over either. The \"homemade\" pasta? I couldn't really judge it, because the sauce that came with it was, and hate to say this, just plain lazy. I'm no culinary expert, but I've made better sauce on my own, and that's what's so frustrating about this place.

(I saw a cheesecake and some other cakes in there like a German chocolate cake (which isn't a true German dessert, by the way), a black forest tort).  Also, I saw German beers on tap like Bitburger, Kostritzer, Tuch, and a couple others, which is pretty representative of the spectrum from pils and ale to dark.  Didn't see Spaten das Optimator, or hefeweizen, but I didn't look hard, either.  I asked for one of their world famous Reuben sandwiches with the red cabbage on it for carry out--it was terrific.  This was just one visit, but I really like this place and want to go again to explore more items.  Six stars if you like German food.","date":"2013-12-28 20:12:59"}

Except for one injection where I felt some pressure, I didn't feel any of the other injections. At one point, I was going to ask him, \"Did you start yet?\" I received Juvederm Volbella because I only wanted filler in my upper lip because it was very small and thin in ratio to my bottom lip.

Technically, I have eaten Ethiopian food once in Washington, DC, but it was about 17 years ago and I was a teenager at the time.  I think my parents chose what we ordered (or maybe the server recommended something) and all I really remember is the part where you use the bread as your utensil.  I've killed a lot of brain cells since then.\n\nMy friend recommended the Beef (Tenderloin) Tibs with Shiro and the Vegetarian Combo.  She also explained to me that while a lot of Ethiopian food is very heavy on the sauce, Desta uses a lighter amount of sauce.  They say that the reason for that is that they're proud of their ingredients.  I can see why, because everything was very good.\n\nIf you ask to share your food between the members of your party, all the food will come out on one huge plate together.  This allows you to eat \"family style\" - and also entertainingly reach across the table pretty far, although fortunately, the tables are small so the reach isn't so bad.  The restaurant thoughtfully provides hand sanitizer at each table, which is probably a good idea when you're eating with your hands and sharing food.\n\nThe Beef Tibs with Shiro was delicious.  I'm a big fan of beef, and this tasted like high-quality meat.  It was seasoned perfectly (for being tasty - I have no way to know what \"perfect\" Ethiopian seasoning is yet) and accompanied by onions, tomatoes and I believe fresh jalapeno pieces.  And the shiro was yummy, too - I love hummus so it's unlikely that I'd ever complain about a flavorful chickpea paste. \n\nThe Vegetarian Platter was great, too.  I wasn't sure of exactly what items I was eating, so I came home and looked at the menu.  After I looked at the menu, I'm still not sure of all the items I ate because I feel like there were things we ate that aren't listed on the menu and vice versa.  (Not that I mind not knowing what I'm eating, because I eat Korean food pretty often now that I live out in BFE and I usually only know what about 30% of the banchan items are.)\n\nAnyway, everything on the veggie plate was good (except that my friend and I did not try the halved fresh jalapeno with tomatoes because neither of us wanted that much fresh jalapeno).  Some items I remember trying were the collard green stew, the split pea stew, more shiro, a beet and potato salad, and a yellow-tinted cabbage dish.  \n\nThere was also a salad of lettuce and tomatoes and a red paste which I loved and think it might have been vegetarian fir fir.  Oh, and there was also a dish that was made out of pieces of injera (the flat sourdough-tasting bread that you use to scoop up your food) and something that tasted like olive oil and maybe vinegar.  From looking at the menu now, I think that may have been a fit fit of some kind.  \n\nMy favorite veggie items were definitely the shiro, the red paste, and the collards.  But there was nothing on that plate that I didn't like.  All of the items were served over more injera.  I guess I should have read the review earlier that mentioned that you are supposed to eat that injera too because it's yummy and has soaked up all the flavors.  Oops.\n\n(Yeah, in retrospect that seems like common sense.  But my friend was minimizing her bread consumption and my week at work has been rough.  I don't think my brain is functioning at full capacity anymore.)\n\nWith all the food we ordered, our total check only came to around 24 bucks.  Not too bad for the opportunity to try a million and one items (well, maybe more like 10 items).  I let satiated but not stuffed, and looking forward to trying some more things the next time I eat at an Ethiopian restaurant.\n\nMy experience at Desta was definitely enjoyable.  The food was great and our service completely on point.  The main reason I'm not giving a full five stars is that I don't feel really qualified to judge Ethiopian food since I have so little experience with it.  Give me time to build a basis for comparison, and this may become 5 stars for me.\n\nOh, and on our way out of the restaurant, we noticed that Desta has a drive thru.  Drive-thru Ethiopian cuisine?  Win.","date":"2010-05-14 10:48:03"}

They only let in so many people at a time as this place is a seat yourself  burger bar. \n\nBecause ACL was in town and the last day of the festival was cancelled due to rain, everyone invaded the SoCo area looking for things to do! We honestly waited in line for about an hour. It is crazy but we were bound and intent to eat here. Our greeter told us what to do once we entered the restaurant as she let us and a few of the other people who were in line in. \n\nAs we were standing in line waiting to place our order, I decided to order a drink from the bar, I cannot remember the name, but it had bourbon and some other stuff in it. The bartender was friendly and made my drink strong. First couple of sips it was good but while we were waiting in line I started to itch and break out in small rashes on my arms and neck. I was super embarrassed walking back to the bar to ask for a refund. Both the bartender and the manager were concerned and offered to make me another drink. Not wanting to piss my body off anymore than it already was I just asked for a refund. The manager said not to worry that it is okay as I told her I have never returned a drink in life.\n\nOne of the servers came up to us after I got back in line and asked how many in our group, Minh said two and we were handed our table number. Was told after we placed our order that we could find our table to the right side of the restaurant.\n\nWe finally made it up to the counter to order, with all that was going on, I completely forgot what I wanted to order hoping Minh would take his sweet time ordering his meal I scanned the menu and found what sounded good to me.\n\n-Magic Shroom Burger with a gluten free bun, Angus Beef, Texas Goat Cheese, Field Mushrooms, Mayo & Basil Pesto.\n\n-Shared some fries y Chile con Queso.\n\nWe got our drink, grabbed some utensils, and found our table. Our waiter brought our food out to us and asked if he could get us anything else (Ketchup, Mustard ect) he even came around and refilled our drink a couple of times! \n\nMy shroom burger was cooked medium well and was full of juicy meaty goodness! The gluten free bun was light and airy and had taste not some stale cardboard excuse for a healthy bun.\nThis burger was huge (it is true, everything is BIGGER in Texas) I found myself having to half my burger which fell a part in the process of cutting so I could eat it.\nOne bite and I was hooked like a fish, the texture of the goat cheese and the mushrooms were the best part! \n\nThe fries and queso were good so good in fact that I totally forgot that I am not really suppose to have any type of queso at all. Sadly, I was somewhat sick back at the hotel for a little bit. However, it was so worth it! Creamy queso with a kick of spice paired with grease free fries seasoned to a prefect crisp. It is everything you ever dreamed of in fries and cheese land!\n\nIt was a perfect burger for a prefect cooler, rainy day in SoCO!  A bonus point was that they loved my fries and queso photo on instagram!

Plus, it was close to work, and I'm a sucker for convenience.\n\nI went to Dr. Tsai for about 18 months for a dry eye situation that I notice the most when I wake up around 3 a.m.  She had me wear my contacts less and less, go on steroid drops, Omega 3 pills, twice daily eyelid washes, warm eye compresses and what I felt were rather regular appointments.  None of it helped.  I still wake up in the middle of the night with eyes that feel like sandpaper.  \n\nIt was the same every appointment.  I'd explain what I was experiencing to Dr. Tsai.  She'd tell me that my dry eyes were related to wearing contacts.  I'd share the fact that I first noticed the dry eye problem when I wore contacts once or twice a year - usually for weddings.  She'd recommend that I wear my contacts less.\n\nThis happened three or four times until I realized that Dr. Tsai wasn't actually listening to me.  She had committed to a specific course of treatment, and there was nothing I could say to change it.\n\nTwo weeks later I went in for my annual eye exam.\n\nAfter the exam, Dr. Tsai launched into a lecture all about the long-term ramifications of dry eye, and how I needed to address my condition - soon.  I had to stop her midsentence and ask if the issue was really that much worse than two weeks earlier when she told me that it was manageable.  That's when I realized something.\n\nShe hadn't bothered to read my patient file before the exam. \n\nI get it.  She sees lots of other patients.  I could have been any one of the hundreds, which is why I have a patient file that holds the details specific to me and my desert like eyes.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I continued to work with Dr. Tsai and her staff while trying to find a new contact lense brand.  On the surface they give the impression that they want to help, but it resulted in a snarky e-mail from a patient care coordinator and the longest two months of my life.  \n\nThat's right - option one was a bust and not even the brand I had requested.  It took them over a week to even order option two.  Then Dr. Tsai tried to feed me a line about how it could take my eyes over two weeks to adjust to a new prescription. \n\nIt turned out that I didn't need to work through the headaches while my eyes adjusted.  The contacts had been ordered with the wrong prescription - specifically the wrong axis.  \n\nDr. Tsai gave me a song and dance about how each contact brand is different from the last.  She told me not to worry. We'd keep at it until we found the right pair.\n\nBy my next appointment, she had ordered the right axis for option two and ordered a third brand.  Neither of which worked for me.  Then she told me that we could continue to work on this, but I'd need to pay another contact fitting fee of close to $100.\n\nYes, I'm demanding.  If I'm wearing corrective lenses, I'd like to see clearly.  Yes, she ordered four pairs of contacts for me - three different brands.  I had specifically asked for one brand, but it wasn't ordered until option two.  At that point, someone ordered the wrong prescription.  \n\nI will only take responsibility for two pairs of contacts.  The other two are squarely on Dr. Tsai and her staff.\n \nAfter all of this, I still don't have a current contact prescription.  And, I'm officially done with The Eye Studio.","date":"2012-08-15 04:06:39"}

I'm talking drool worthy best-meal-I've-ever-had dish. So when it came time for my 30th birthday dinner that's obviously what I wanted. I'd literally been dreaming about this salmon! If I were to base this review on that experience it'd be a 5 star, hands down.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive but things came out horribly slow. We got apps and drinks and were done with our appetizers and waited at least 10-15 more minutes before our meals came out. Slow to the point where I thought maybe our meals had been forgotten about. I ordered another drink and by the time I got it I didn't want it anymore slow.\n\nThe food came out and it didn't look quite as I remembered. It didn't taste quite as I remembered. In fact, it was pretty disappointing. \n\nMaybe it was because they had a rehearsal dinner going on, but I was not satisfied at all.  The service was slow, the food was disappointing, the overall experience just left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).

I simply don't see it. I eat here probably 3-4 times a month and half dine in and half carry out. I have never had a bad experience with service.

There were lots of couples with babies and families coming in for cuts. I signed in and they said the wait would be about 25 minutes. They had lots of free food...delicious chocolate cake, cookies, tacos from Zocalo, cheese and crackers.

As for the cut, well, it's not the best cut I've had but it's not the worst. The person who cut my hair was nice enough and seemed competent but there was no chance for her to check the cut after it was dry and tweak as necessary.

I remember I used to come here based on the premise that it was the \"best Pho in Austin.\" I'm not sure if I really agree with that, mainly because I don't remember.\nThe drive here is always fun, as the restaurant is located right after a big dip in the hilly road. As I walk in, I always notice the empty buffet to the left. I don't know what time of the day they do buffet, because I have never seen it open (granted, I've only been here like 3 times). \nI guess I never noticed before because I've never had it, but the first thing I noticed when I opened the menu was the PAPAYA SALAD! Having had it at every meal in Thailand, it was imperative that I order it because I have yet to find it at any restaurant in the US. The menu offers it with shrimp but the waitress recommended I try the squid. \nThe flavor is not as strong and pungent as it was in Thailand, but this is to be expected. It still had the light refreshing taste of the papaya that I love, though. The grilled and skewered squid was a nice addition, making the perfect appetizing starter. \nI actually didn't opt for Pho at this visit and decided to try the vermicelli bowl instead. It had a good sauce, but for once I feel like they didn't put enough. Most of the time whenever I eat out at Asian places, it's like sodium overload. For this, there was a lot of vermicelli and not an adequate amount of sauce, making the overall taste pretty bland. However, once some of the vermicelli has been eaten and the sauce\/noodle ratio was more appropriate, this dish was actually very delicious. The portion was huge also, I had to take some to go. \nIf I do not find another place to fill my papaya salad crave, then I MUST come back to 888 sometime in the future.","date":"2012-02-29 21:23:25"}

She was extremely attentive and friendly.\n- Atmosphere. It was hip enough for SoCo or any large urban city.\n- Beer Selection. A refined selection of micro brews.\n- Chipolte Catsup. Home made goodness, not too sweet just the right amount of heat.\n- Chile Cheese. We used it for a dipping sauce for our burgers... YUM.\n- Camaraderie of our fellow diners waiting in the \"40 min\" queue. It was fun to strike up a conversation about how this dining experience was starting to feel like an \"E\" ticket ride at Disney - there is something GREAT at the of this line and we will be reward for our patiences.\n\nWe really wanted to like our whole dining experience at Hopdoddy but the burgers unfortunately were dry and the accompanying veggies did not maintain their expected crispness. The queuing concept a la \"Fuddruckers\" could have been more effective if there were more than 2 smiling faces waiting to take your order. When we arrived this past Saturday night, we told the wait just order our food would be 40 mins, we were steps from the front door (.... and I \"know\"..... what was I expecting, it is SATURDAY night  for god's sake). Luckily, the queue flows past the bar where you are able pick up drink while waiting. \nAnd so like any good troopers, we made the best of our experience  focusing on the all of the things we enjoy about our evening - chatting it up with the people in the queue, marveling at the creative way an 8 top table could be transformed to accommodate a combination of various sized dining parties by merely moving a panel that resembled a large chalk board establishing a new line of demarcation, the amazing Chile Cheese sauce, and the fact we did try someplace new for dinner.","date":"2011-02-13 16:12:11"}

Stains on the walls, bathroom was not clean , shower still had hair in it! \nThe bar in the restaurant is fine, if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn't know the first thing about making a drink. Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant. I was not expecting 5 star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible! The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon, stale bread and bagels, eggs were never brought out.

It tries too hard with its microscopic, unreadable black writing, clever titles and statements like 'open eight days a week.' Barf. Portland doesn't need places to try any harder than they already do. Let's agree to not give the rest of the world reasons to make fun of us.\n\nMoving along.\n\nCrab Rangoon--This isn't your favorite Thai restaurant's crab rangoon. The crab is so fresh, so delicate, so tasty. The won tons were cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet.\n\nIn fact, many of the dishes here incorporate amazing flavor combinations and a stunningly perfect heat.\n\nChinese Sausage Corn Dog--This was the only miss. My first bite was all dough and frankly, all donut. In fact, I'm guessing this is the same dough they use in the donut dessert. But as is, it missed the mark. The sausage is too sweet and gets lost in the sweet dough. The hot mustard is almost inedible, so there is nowhere to take this sweet, carby mass on a stick. Skip it.\n\nOnion & Butter Sandwich--Everyone knows that James Beard was the mac daddy of all chefs. Actually, I have no idea who James Beard was (is?), but I know if you're a James Beard chef, you're pretty amazing. I also know this sandwich of stinky, fatty, Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook items is heavenly, I mean completely divine in my mouth. \n\nBrussels Sprouts & Ground Lamb--True perfection. I'm not a fan of sprouts, I merely tolerate them. This is a complex dish in which every bite makes a statement and invites you back for more. This dish embodies a team--the individual ingredients are less powerful than the way they work together. \n\nKorean Fried Game Hen--Plenty of meat on this bone, deliciously fried and flavored. Like the other dishes, you practically want to lick the plate because it's covered in special sauce and other tiny, sweet morsels.\n\nThe space is great--modern, romantic, hip, intimate, but maybe a bit cramped and way too dark for food that amazing. It's like she's trying to prevent the food porn culture from plastering every moment on Instagram. \n\nOur server was really friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic. I thought it was a little much when the gentleman who delivered our food told us that the silverware was made of radon (see paragraph one).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Naomi Pomeroy proves that in Portland, it's quality, not quantity that wins. You don't have to own 10 restaurants (or even three) to make a statement in this town. In fact, I'd like her to stay small, stay focused and stay amazing because of it. \n\nOne of the best meals around. I'll be back again and again.

They are obviously pre-made and refrigerated, and they're probably not what you're in the mood for anyway (you won't find anything fresh-made, nothing hot, nothing deep-fried, nothing fusion- just the basic regulars, pre-made and retrieved from the fridge when you order it). Back when I first started coming to Banzai I only ate nigiri, so I didn't know how bad the rolls were. Don't get me wrong, they won't give you food poisoning or anything- they're just not good. The nigiri, though, is decent, if a bit over-priced for the portions. It's great for a quick bite though- the service is decent and fast and the servers are friendly. I also LOVE their bento boxes- they're a really good deal and delicious, especially the salmon one. You can also get an assortment of those Japanese fad drinks, which I like because you can't get those at most other sushi places. The tonkatsu is also good- with pork the way I like it, as opposed to with chicken the way it's offered at almost every other Japanese place in Austin. The lunch specials are okay- they give me the same pre-made and thawed impression I get from the rolls, but they aren't bad tasting, although the portions are a little small. Overall the place is decent. Not worth going out of your way for, but if you know to avoid the rolls you won't leave unhappy.","date":"2010-11-22 14:27:32"}

Overall, the food is usually quite good, but occasionally the flavor, quality, and portions can be inconsistent.  \n\nPart of the issue might be that by trying to execute on so many different types of Japanese cuisine, they can't be excellent at all of them.  There are other spots in Portland that do individual dishes (e.g., sushi, ramen) better, but none that offer a one-stop-shop of so many types of Japanese food.\n\nThey have decent sushi, but it's the other menu items that keep us coming back (it's similar to Maneki in Seattle in that way).\n\nThe yakitori-style skewer options were especially good with the tsukune (ground chicken) and pork belly (technically not yakitori since it's not chicken) becoming favorites.\n\nIt has a fun, lively, izakaya vibe, but the furnishings and extensive menu sometimes make it feel like a caricature of a Japanese restaurant.\n\nEarly and late happy hours are good times to sample across their menu (fewer choices than their regular menu but still a lot more variety than most happy hours)\n\nService is usually good, but can be slow when the restaurant is really busy, especially at dinner.  Waits for a table can be very long.","date":"2017-02-19 08:45:08"}

But since it's in the Good Food Here pod, that's pretty much a given.\n\nI've tried 3 of the dishes, though I don't remember all of the specifics. One of them had sweet glazed pork, which I had never had before... but will definitely have again. Yum! For some of the dishes, the items are separated out on the plate, allowing you to add as much jalepeno or specific veggies as you want. \n\nFor the meat dishes, I think the price is a bit steep  - $7.50 for a decent sized plate of food (the other northern Thai carts have bigger portions for this price). But the vegetarian dishes (or at least the pad dish that I had last time) are a dollar cheaper while still being just as tasty and filling. So as far as economical eating goes, the veg dishes are your best bet, but the other dishes are still really, really yummy - don't cross them off your list completely.","date":"2011-01-09 01:37:49"}

Two, the dining room was very large and quite noisy, even at 8:00 at night.  Still not a deal breaker. My main issue was with the ambiance.  With a restaurant called The Wave, with a waiting area that is all lit up in ocean blue, it was very confusing to have an orange and gold, retro vibe throughout.  Kind of confusing.

The dim lighting and decor is very classy and chic.  Despite having a reservation and the restaurant not being very crowded, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to provide suggestions based on what my friend and I were in the mood for.  Because it was Dine Out Boston, there was a pre-fixe menu to choose courses from for $38, with several items to add for an up-charge.  We started with the tuna tartar, which was nice and fresh, although had a \"different\" flavor to it which I could not pick up on and did not love.  The quail yoke on the tuna tartar was neat, but did not provide much flavor.  We also shared the porcini flatbread, which was thin and crispy with a subtle mushroom flavor-not too overbearing.  I had the scallop entree, which came with four large, nicely seared scallops over mashed cauliflower, with roasted cauliflower, broccoli and golden raisins.  This dish was delicious and not too heavy-the waiter steered me in the right direction!  My friend had the bolognese, which was a mix of veal and oxtail, served over home-made rigatoni.  This was also delicious, with right amount of sauce over the pasta and a nice portion size.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu with dolce de leche gelato.  It was good- but I was hoping it would be better, seeing we were in the North End.  The bottom layer was overly moist and the top layers were quite dry.  Overall, we had an enjoyable meal.  In the future, I'd like to eat outside as the seating is on the water.","date":"2014-08-24 19:35:55"}

I was given an estimate of 1-2 hours, which was understandable given that the weather was crappy.\n\nAfter 2.5 hours I contacted GrubHub to find out where my food was.  If the restaurant needed to cancel because of weather or some other reason, that is one thing, but I heard nothing from them.  GrubHub reached out to the restaurant who said they were starting my order and promised it would be delivered in 25-30 ADDITIONAL minutes.  The restaurant had confirmed this, and I was told they were offering the delivery service directly.  OK, fine, at least I will get to eat dinner, and at this point it's too late to order delivery or pickup anywhere else.\n\nAt 3.5 hours, I contacted them again and subsequently received an email saying the order was cancelled because it was after 9:00, and the restaurant was closed.  I realize the GrubHub shares the blame here, but this is abysmal customer service from City Thai.  It is honestly inexcusable.  It is one thing to need to cancel an order because of weather, or driver issues, etc, but to provide (sparse) updates confirming that the order will be delivered and then simply close is un-freaking-believable.

Great atmosphere, great prices, and great staff!\n\nWe showed up around 6pm; just before the dinner rush. It was quiet and we were sat pretty quickly. Our waitress came up and was nice and quirky.  She gave us input and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. She took our order and within 10 min we had our side salads. We actually had our salads before we received our drinks! \n\nMy Fianc√© and I both ordered the \"pick 3.\" (best deal in my opinion) She had the Grilled Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, and Fried Catfish. Shrimp was really good. Big and delicious! (Her words, not mines)  The salmon was so good!  It was kind dry, but a little lemon made the whole salmon taste amazing! Lastly was the catfish. No fishy after taste and was fried to perfection! Her sides were a side salad with Lemon Herb & Vinaigrette. (Absolutely amazing dressing if you don't like ranch) She also had steamed broccoli they were good. Just steamed broccoli...\n\nFor my 3, I chose the Atlantic Salmon, Crawfish √âtouff√©e, and Fried Catfish. I'll start with my sides. I had the Red Beans and Rice. It was okay. Sadly I think Popeye's makes it better. I upsized my side and got a cup of Gumbo. A little spicy for me but it was too good to not eat all of it! Very filling too! A bowl of that would probably fill me up.  \nThe Salmon was good. Again, a little dry but a little lemon juice put it over the top!  The Crawfish √âtouff√©e was scrumptious! It doesn't looks like much, but the rice will fill you up before you realize it. Lastly was the Fried Catfish. It was great! Cooked to perfection! Had some ketchup and some lemon. I had to take a fillet home with me. (That's right a 325 lb. man couldn't finish his plate.) That's how generous the portions are!\n\nFor an appetizer we had the Fried Calamari. My Fianc√© loves it here because it doesn't taste like you are eating grease. It was good but didn't WOW me. In my opinion it was a little chewy. I like my Calamari to be a little crunchier. Great taste though! I would definitely order them again. \n\nThere is one innovative item they have that I can't go without mentioning. It's this lemon net they have for when you squeeze the lemon onto your seafood. It kept the seeds in, and you didn't have lemon juice spray everywhere. Instead it made a controlled flow for the lemon juice to be spread evenly. It change my life! I'm never letting citrus fruit spray anyone around me ever again! \n\nAll in All I would rate this place with 4 Stars. Beer and wine selection isn't the greatest. It did get a little noisy during the rush hour (I know I'm being a uppity about a little noise) and for a Friday I felt they were under staffed. \nThe reason I am giving a 5 star review is because of our waitress Patience (that's her actual name) was freakin awesome! Attentive and fast. Didn't matter she was overwhelmed. She kept a great attitude and made our experience memorable. \nPatience if you end up reading this. You were awesome! If I weren't ballin on a budget I would have give more then 25%.  If I ever go back, I can only hope to get you again.","date":"2017-10-02 01:54:08"}

I get it, most nail salons are like that but it makes me question if they are even licensed to be doing my nails. The language barrier leaves a lot of room for misunderstandings.\n\nSecondly, they were in a rush to leave so they did my manicure and pedicure simultaneously which was uncomfortable because they were trying to twist my body in uncomfortable ways. The lady doing my manicure was skipping steps (. I'm a licensed cosmetologist so I know how manicures are supposed to be done) she also couldn't understand my English when I politely corrected her. She was standing I front of the tv the whole time so I had no choice but to stare off into space. At one point the staff we're arguing with each other which made me very uneasy as I'm trying to relax. The straw that broke the camels back was when the manicurist was trying to rinse my hands in the water my feet had been soaking in. She didn't speak or give me direction, she just pulled my hands rather aggressively down towards my feet and cause me to accidentally kick my legs forward. My left fiit, which was submerged in the water, banged against the tub. My right root was getting worked on by the guy doing my pedicure and caused me to kick him. It was very awkward and embarrassing. I even passed gas. The other clients were staring because of the yelp I made when my toe got banged.\nTwo days later, my toe has finally stopped throbbing.\n\nIt was not pleasant and it took them way too long to finish everything since they wasted so much time being in each other's way and arguing.\n\nIn the end I must say the older gentleman who did my pedicure was very polite and did an excellent job manicuring my feet from start to finish.

We brought the kids here for their first time, got there around 9:30 for a 10:00 opening and was glad when they opened early. However, it quickly went downhill from there. Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for \"technical difficulties.\" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! Dark clouds should not shut down rides! Anyway....\n\nAt Journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kinda took the fun out of the ride.\n\nOn a positive note, we saw the Dolphin and Sea Lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. I personally loved Antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. That was really cool. \n\nLastly, the park closed at 6 PM but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 PM to try to usher you out of the park. An employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. I have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it. To sum it all up, my teenager described it as a broken down Six Flags, but way worse. Save your money and go somewhere else!","date":"2018-09-25 03:18:47"}

In addition to the BBQ for the main dishes (which was outstanding), our table ordered 3 appetizers. Fries, which were good and a decent portion. Tater tots - $10 for 8 tater tots. That is out of line. I was expecting something at least close to the size of the fries. The other appetizer was the veggies. Again, good, but the portion was tiny. The portion was less than I would expect a normal side to be with a dinner. If they can work on either the pricing or the portion size of the appetizers, this would easily be 5 stars because it all tastes great (at least that is the consensus - I wasn't quick enough on the draw to be able to try the veggies or tater tots) I would definitely go back again, but would forego the apps unless changes are made.","date":"2016-11-21 19:43:37"}

Well, the place wasn't as independent as I was hoping. Still a fair commercial feel going on inside complete with ‚Ñ¢s on the menu. Corporate places can get the theme down and polished but sometimes lack in authenticity once the place is running.\n\nThe place is kind of like a cross between Quisnos and Jimmy Johns. The sandwiches are very meat-centric. The feel of the place is like they were trying for a bit of an east coast vibe but the only part they really got to was the random yelling of words by the staff.\n\nI get to the line, browse through the quite large bottled beverage selection to see all the typical mass-produced overly sugary selections. Passed on the beverages. Moved passed to order my sandwich. Opted for A Wreck for myself who's ingredients read like an Italian sandwich, and a Hammie for the kiddo. It's ham and cheese.\n\nI was a bit impressed with guy1's calm demeanor in a place that's still fairly busy at a peak dinner time. Was preparing the order ahead of me while simultaneously taking my order and writing nothing down or entering anything into an order and he took the order calmly and confidently and didn't make me feel rushed and his demeanor didn't make me feel like he was rushed or over-worked.\n\nThe odd part is the yelling. Once I put in my order he yells out my order and the other two yell the order back to suggest that they heard him. This is a cheap gimmick pulled from fish markets and east coast shops. Guy1's like \"Hey, I'm making a sandwich!\" and the other two chirp back \"He's making a sandwich\/That guy's making a sandwich!\"\n\nIs this really necessary? Guy2's whole job is to take the meat and cheese bread off the toaster that Guy1 put in place and put your choice of 9 different condiments and vegetables on the sandwich for 8 hours straight. Should he really be so surprised to find a sandwich manifest itself onto his side of the toaster without the guy yelling into the side of his head from 3 feet away? I'd like to see some headsets secret agent style where they whisper into their sleeves that the customer who just walked passed them and the sign on the door that says \"Potbelly Sandwich Shop\" is indeed here to order a sandwich and is definitely not lost.\n\nI'm such a slacker on receipts. I forget to take them and when they tell me the total of my order they might as well be telling me what they heard on The View last night, because I'm not listening.\n\nA Wreck reminded me of a toasted version of The Italian Night Club from Jimmy Johns, but toasted and on ciabatta and smaller, but I think I ordered the smaller one. The hot peppers actually have some spice to them, where Jimmy's are sweet and zesty these have a mild spice that slowly accumulates until the end of the sandwich where it's still tolerable to my sensibilities. The cured meats actually kind of taste like cured meats, which is always a bonus. Sometimes at these shops it just tastes like a slightly more flavorful bologna.\n\nI nabbed a bit of the Hammie from the kiddo. (for science). The ham was quite flavorful where many others just taste like muted versions of themselves. Notes of smokiness and well hydrated without tasting like it was reconstituted in it's own juices like the turkey packets you get at the grocery store. It's truly noteworthy that most of the sandwich made it into the kids mouth! You parents know this means something!\n\nTo test the practicality of the yelling, I've decided to make this a practice at home when I'm up at 6:30 making breakfast. \"I'm making Cap'n Crunch‚Ñ¢!\" I'll update and let you know how it works in a week. (No I won't).","date":"2015-03-18 19:55:04"}

But this experience must be shared.\n\nYesterday a fellow yelper and I went to Hyde Park for a early afternoon margarita. (We're grad students and it's the end of the semester. It's a necessary thing.) Anyway, the first glaring if not unforgivable slip up was when the waiter reversed our mango and lime margaritas, even after insisting that he was giving them to us the right way around. (It took us the entire time we were their to figure this out. We both just thought ours tasted funny. Grad school has rotted our brains.)\n\nThe unforgivable part of the experience came next. A couple of young college students were seated next to us. They ordered fries and were brought waters. My friend was in the middle of venting about a particularly frustrating experience but I was suddenly somewhat distracted by the way the couple next to us was acting about their waters. \n\n\"Is that a shrimp?\" I heard them ask.\n\nThe waiter came by, apologized briefly and took the waters away. We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters! A big one at that-- We could see the shadow of it from our table!\n\nBut it wasn't only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didn't notice it. Ultimately, I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation. There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal. No manager swooped in and said he'd make it right.\n\nInstead, the waiter went back and got the couple new waters. Directly from the ice bin this time, he said. He apologized briefly again and that was it. \n\nThe couple, thoroughly mortified, left. We quickly finished our margaritas and went on to Julio's down the street for our second...","date":"2008-04-29 13:22:52"}

I tried the closest Planet Fitness and WOW locations and found they were GROSSLY overpopulated. Getting a machine at either location wasn't at all possible at peak times, so I went to meet with Camille and Josh to tour Anytime Fitness in September. After seeing the open availability of machines, and the \"anytime\" access, I was sold. Even though the space may be smaller than the big box gyms, the availability of access spreads the \"busy times\" throughout the day where there's never a crowd when you decide to go. I've never had an issue getting a machine or weight when I need to and I am a regular visitor (probably not as regular as I should be, thanks for pointing that out!). The demographic of members is very easy going. No \"gym-rats\" or kids, every one is very respectful and clean which is key in a gym for me. \n\nEquipment set up here is perfect for me. It's got everything I could want to use from treadmills and bikes, to free weights and a good variety of machines to work out in any manner I could want. Management is also very accommodating to requests for new equipment and services and encourage members to come up with new suggestions. I have left a suggestion or two on the chalkboard, which is a nice touch. It sort of \"personalizes\" the gym for me. Very rare nowadays.\n\nFor any place I give 5-stars to, I force myself to also list a \"con\" just to show I am not TOTALLY brainwashed :), and the only thing I could think of here, and it's prevalent in a lot of gyms I have noticed, is a lack of WiFi availability I guess? Besides that, I can't find anything I haven't liked about being a member of Anytime Fitness. I look forward to being a renewing customer next year.\n\nEDIT: 12\/14\/12\n\nI am leaving the above review untouched so people can see what I typed originally. I don't believe in going back and changing the original review. But went into Anytime Fitness today to find a pleasant surprise.. they've added WiFi to the gym after a couple of us made the suggestion. That was my only \"gripe\" even though my AT&T unlimited data plan works fine. WiFi just helps on battery life. So that problem is fixed! Why haven't you joined yet?","date":"2012-12-04 03:26:54"}

They didn't even have a standard spicy salmon roll on their menu; I had to ask if it was possible for them to make one (since they had spicy tuna roll), and thankfully they were willing to. I talked to a friend afterwards and apparently you could substitute tuna with salmon on their other rolls too, so I guess I could try next time. \n\nWe also ordered the chopped scallop roll, smoked salmon garlic roll, unagi roll, and Hot N Roll - most of which were below average in my opinion. The scallop roll was mostly cucumber and didn't have much flavour, and the smoked salmon was also rather tasteless. The unagi roll had a lot of bones in it. The only roll that turned out good was the Hot N Roll.","date":"2018-01-21 07:06:28"}

She'd recently got her first tattoo and actually went back to get another one from him a few weeks later. I'd been to one shop before coming here and I didn't have a pleasant experience so I didn't end up getting anything done. I decided to give 10th street a try since my friend had a great experience. I called Mark on a Thurs so I could talk to him and let him know what I was interested in and to see his availibility for Friday. I told him the size and words I wanted, he said it was pretty straight forward. I also mentioned to him my trip to the beach in a little over 3 weeks and he said I'd be fine. \n\nAfter work on Friday I drove straight to 10th street. I showed Mark the pictures on my phone of the words and symbol and showed him the placement on my body. He said it was great and he could definitely do it and it wouldn't take long...like max 15 min. That was great for me because it being my first one and not knowing what to expect-- the quicker the better lol. I felt very comfortable here. \n\nBefore he started the tattoo, I was able to see exactly where it would be and how it would look to make sure it was the exact location. I decided to move it slightly. I'm glad I was able to preview it though...being that it's permanent and all. \n\nOnce I got in the chair I tried to relax. He told me to let him know if I needed him to stop or anything like that but reassured me I'd be okay. I'm glad someone thought I'd be okay because I wasn't sure I was going to be lol. We talked through the whole thing which caused me to be at ease. It didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought-- actually it didn't really hurt at all. A few times it was uncomfortable but just something you'd grit your teeth over. He was done before I knew it. I went to look at the final product and was extremely happy. It was exactly what I'd been wanting for so many years. \n\nIf youre getting your first tattoo or a tattoo in general I fully recommend 10th street. They are great, everyone is nice.

This was a truly exquisite use of seafood in carpaccio; the presentation was beautiful. The menu describes Octopus Carpaccio as \"roast tomato pasato, castelvetrano, dijon & shallot vinaigrette.\" In addition, beets, red onions, micro greens and croutons finished the dish. This is one of the most unique presentations of octopus that I have ever seen and Posto pulled it off masterfully. \n\nFor Entr√©e I had the \"White Gulf Shrimp, skillet roasted, white wine, oven cured tomatoes, red chile, clipped herbs, tagliatelle pasta.\" This was an excellent change from their pizza. The shrimp were tender, cooked perfectly and white wine sauce was almost a beure blanc preparation, accented nicely with by the chile and roasted tomatoes. Well done.

The one star is for their horribly rude service. \n\nI was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down\/wrapping up\/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.\n\nPoint of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM.

I am so very glad they did.\n\nWe had reservations, and though I don't think we needed them, we were seated promptly and the host was a pretty funny guy.  Our server was pretty awesome too - he kept us taken care of and in drinks the whole evening.  \n\nFor appetizers, our friends ordered the curried mussels with a side of naan, and I, not a huge mussel fan, decided to order the hummus and naan combo.  Once they brought both plates, I figured out that I don't mind mussels at all if they are coated IN THE SAUCE OF LOVE.  I would bathe in this sauce if I could.  Our server tried to take it away once the mussels were gone and we pretty much slapped his hand and just asked for MOAR NAAN.  \n\nFor dinner, we all ordered a hodge podge of food and went for it family style.  The mixed grill from the tandoor was probably actually my least favorite, some of the meat was a little chewy, but saying that, it was still pretty good.  The Goan Yellow Curry with shrimp was a surprise standout for me - I'm usually not that much into those coconuty flavors as I just want some spice, but it was a perfect balance.  The vindaloo had good flavor, but didn't kill us.  And, the saag paneer was solid.  Creamy, cheesy, tasty.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how we also put desert in our faces, but we shared some rice pudding (kheer), carrot cake w\/ice cream (Gajjar Halwa), and the standout for me was the little donuts in the fried sauce of peace and harmony (Gulab Jamun).  \n\nAll in all, a super fun night with friends, a good date night place for sure.

I also tried their lamb sliders but as a lamb snob I much rather stick with traditional Greek and Turkish venues. We were a party of four and left with leftovers so the portions are reasonable.

I spent that $10 for you, readers. And didn't finish my watery dark and stormy (was there actually alcohol in it? I couldn't really tell). I was seated at a corner table downstairs, underneath an overhang. My brother only bumped his head on the ceiling once or twice, and the protruding corner after one beer. The beer list was decent (saving grace?).\n\nWe split the fries with truffle oil for the appetizer, I had the tuna salad, sister-in-law had another salad, and Bro had the much hyped lobster mac n'cheese. Hm. \n\nThe fries were hot, that's always nice. I could *kind of* taste the truffle oil, I guess it was a nice little addition to the fairly run-of-the mill fries, but that's pretty much all I can say about it. This might be a nice thing to get if you're just there for a drink or two (get beer or wine for yourself, seriously, avoid the mix drinks) and want something greasy to go along with it. \n\nThe salads were decent but overdressed--the lettuce on mine was good lettuce but I couldn't taste it because of all of the oil! The tuna was done really well, though, by really well I mean almost completely rare, which is how I roll with tuna steak. Maybe a straight up tuna steak would be good at this place, I'll never know. \n\nOk, on to the Mac N'Cheese. Seriously guys? All those people who raved about this stuff--do you really like the cheese to pool at the bottom of the bowl rather than being thick enough to be included in each bite of the food?? The taste was decent (I mean, cheesy lobster is really tough to eff up) but I thought the consistency was pretty nasty. The thin creamy cheese didn't make sense in a signature dish, and my brother started to wonder if he even likes mac n'cheese at all after how bummed he was about his meal. Trust me Bro, let's go to Zaftigs and get some real mac n'cheese before you make up your mind on that one.\n\nI don't plan to go back to this place. I liked the art, but there were so many older people there, it was a little weird to chill out with a bunch of septuagenarians in front of photos of half naked women.","date":"2009-03-01 23:09:20"}

I didn't have any expectations because I had never heard about it before. \n\nThe hostess was away when we walked in, but returned shortly and seated us pleasantly and promptly. I was pleasantly surprised looking over the menu at the variety of selections. My Mom and I love to try a lot of different plates so we decided to share the beet salad, the risotto fritters (why don't they just call them arancini?) and the grilled stuffed zucchini appetizers instead of entrees. \n\nOur waitress, Melissa, was really polite and helpful - she refilled my Mom's tea without being asked and brought our dishes in the order we requested. I will definitely ask to sit in her section again. \n\nOK the food - the beet salad was a revelation. It tasted like they had roasted fresh beets - not canned. We were both scrapping the plate. Both the risotto fritters and the baked zucchini came with tomato sauce that was fresh, chunky and had a great balance of acid and sweet flavors. The food all tasted fresh and carefully prepared. \n\nSo why only 4 stars? \n\nWe ended with cheesecake that was supposed to come with raspberry coulis. We expected a sauce. We got a drizzle. It was definitely lacking compared to the description. \n\nAlso, the ladies room needed a lot of tiding up - there was paper all over the floor. Considering this was a Monday lunch and it wasn't crowded (there were servers cleaning the dining room) the ladies room should have been in top shape. \n\nWe paid less than $40 for 2 apps, a salad, a dessert and a tea. I found that to be a good deal. I will be back.","date":"2010-01-08 03:29:50"}

It was my first time there and it was a cool looking venue with a lot of activities, large parking lot, well lit, and we planned to make a night of it but the dinner went so badly we didn't bother. After ordering at 6:30, the food came out in very separate waves starting at 7:30 so no one ate at the same time. My pizza never came out despite following up with the waitress each time we saw her (which was only about 4 times in the 3 hours). We finally chased down a manager to find our checks and she said she would do me a favor and remove the pizza. I pointed out I had never received a pizza and she told me I had. The entire interaction was baffling. It took about another half an hour to get a check for the one drink I had, which the manager then decided to comp. They did also offer a free play card, which I declined as I needed to leave and eat, and didn't care to ever return. I really wanted my 3 hours back more than the free drink or arcade time. I was utterly starving at that point so I left and went to the Chipotle up the street, 3 hours after I had sat down to eat at Main Event. The people who did receive their food enjoyed it despite the wait, and I do appreciate that they comped my drink (and, I guess, my pizza I forgot to remember eating).","date":"2017-03-27 02:09:45"}

The portions of meat in everything were very small. It's like they took a thin slice of meat and cut it into a few pieces. The bowl of vermicelli was even filled with way too many bean sprouts instead of vermicelli - so they could save on noodles?

The place itself ain't anything to write home about: it has about 6 booths and wood paneling but always has at least one family of locals chowing down and I like how they bring a pizza stand to the table so you don't have to rearrange dishes and what-not.

And for a grand total of $28 (I nearly fainted when my Mom said how much it was), you definitely can't go wrong!","date":"2008-12-03 19:41:08"}

It's very dark and pub-like inside with dark woods and a rather tired and outdated decor.  The booths and tables have seen better days and could use a sprucing or recovering.  The large bar is on the left and wraps around the dining \/ main seating area.  We were greeted and seated immediately and given menus.  Our waiter was very friendly and jovial, introduced himself and took our drink orders.\n\nThe menu has a few appetizers, three soup selections, a few salads, burgers, sandwiches --plus unusual pub fare such as chicken pot pie, meatloaf, chili and fried shrimp or fish.  They also offer a couple of steaks, salmon and desserts.  Tonight we tried the fish n chips, the spinach salad, the chicken tenders platter and the ribeye with a baked potato and salad.  Our beer and bar drinks arrived and then we waited 40 minutes for the salads and another 25 for the entrees.  It seemed way too long to wait especially since it was not busy or crowded.\n\nWhen the entrees came they were ok but cold; the baked potato's butter didn't melt because the potato was too cool.  The fish was heavily breaded but the fries and cole slaw were pretty good.  The steak was cold and tasted old like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for a while.  Chicken tenders with sweet potato fries were good but needed to be hotter in temperature.  Spinach salad was large and the vinaigrette on the side had been warmed.\n\nTotal for two beers, two bar drinks and four entrees was $104.90 including tip.","date":"2016-12-04 02:58:34"}

It was a pretty late decision so not much research had been done beforehand. They have a pretty wide space, and we were put further in the back, a bit awkward since we were right next to the cash register, but nothing awful. It was however early and empty enough that I was wondering why we weren't seated elsewhere.\n\nWhen I first sat down I thought the beer menu was the regular menu, it's that big. The menu for food is something that just fits on your placemat, but the beer menu has pages upon pages of drinks. The guys got beers, while I got an Ice Box which tasted more like an iced coffee than anything alcoholic, and my cousin got Peach Bellini which she also enjoyed.\n\nAlthough I really enjoyed my drink I found my food average. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Breakfast Club. I loved the tater tots, those were delicious, but I found the sandwich itself kind of clunky and dry. The chicken breast wasn't heavily battered, so it tasted more like a slightly floured piece of chicken as opposed to the crunchy \"KFC style chicken\" I'd been expecting. The egg was also overcooked, although I probably should've asked for over easy. But basically there were two layers of the sandwich, or three pieces of waffle bread. I thought there would be a tomato or something else with moisture in it since the egg wasn't runny, but no. Because of this I found the sandwich very difficult to eat, I had to drench the entire thing with all of the maple syrup I was given and that still wasn't enough.\n\nMy family seemed fine with their choices, and I actually had a pretty good time here despite the mediocre sandwich. I might come back again, but with a different order.","date":"2015-04-15 08:06:07"}

A couple months back, I had the pleasure of going to the Water Grill in downtown Los Angeles, a restaurant that holds 1 Michelin star (at least when they had a Michelin guide in LA). It was very good, but in my opinion B&G Oysters is definitely better. We ended up at B&G at 5:30 on a Saturday (the only res we could get a week ahead of time). It seemed like a great place to take my aunt and uncle while they were in town doing touristy things. \n\nFor our apps, we ordered the fried clams and the mussels.The fried clams were clearly pretty fresh and the dipping sauce was great. The mussels on the other hand were spectacular. We agreed that these were some of the most tender mussels that any of us had ever had, and they were quite flavorful as well. \n\nFor our entrees, my aunt and uncle both ordered some fish that they had never tried before, ordered the salmon, and my girlfriend ordered the lobster roll. The lobster roll was quite good and very lightly dressed (the way I like it). She also had coleslaw and fries on the side. While the coleslaw was pretty standard, the fries were very good. I loved that they decided to opt for tarragon and cilantro on the fries. For my salmon, I have to say that this was easily the most crispy fish skin I have ever had on a piece of fish. The fish itself was quite tasty as well. Oh...and the sauce...the sauce, so good. The chorizo added an element of saltiness that I thought was welcome and often lacking from fish in restaurants. We opted to avoid dessert and go out for ice cream instead, but overall it was a fantastic experience. The service was generally good as well.

After some research and thought, decided to pick a steakhouse and came across Flemings. When I looked at their restaurant week menu, I saw two filet mignon entrees. That did it, and Flemings we went. \n\nThe place was dimly lit inside but spacious and had a warm but cool (not temperature cool...but joe cool cool) atmosphere to it. Everything looked fancy but not too snotty. It was nice. Our waitress was great! She was so professional and polite, very soft spoken but gave out a positive attitude. She was great. However, the servers (they looked like staff that went to all the tables to deliver the entrees) must have been either really busy or confused because they had our entrees mixed up between the four of us on the table. We had to clarify a few times. I guess that was one of the reason I only gave four stars. \n\nThe food itself was good. Our filet mignon was cooked just as we requested and flavorful. Not too salty, not too bland. It was a lot smaller than I thought but it was enough since we got plenty of side dishes. Wine selection was great and my glass went perfect with the entree. Overall, we got a great deal. Originally, the main entree I got was over $40 by itself...but thanks to restaurant week, I got myself that same entree as part of a 3-course meal for under $35. YES. \n\nI'll probably go back to this place...for a date so the dude can pay :)","date":"2012-03-30 02:40:25"}

Fairly busy on a weekend night. \n\nI decided I was in the mood for one of my regular favourites, the mango pomelo sago dessert (Ê•äÊûùÁîòÈú≤) and was met with a satisfying dessert. Nice and sweet with a decent amount of fruits included as well. My dessert was only $8.00 + tax\/tip, which although isn't cheaper than the Icy Bar takeout locations is still a good place to come sit down for a dessert and chill out. The positive is that this menu has much more selection than the takeout locations and includes things such as waffles which I don't think I've seen before at the other takeout locations.\n\nOverall, this is a great location. I thought that the staff were super friendly and were pretty attentive to their customers. Another good thing is that they do accept visa and debit so cash is not necessary!","date":"2017-04-30 07:02:13"}

So, with it being such a popular choice for the weekend I anticipated a great meal. Sadly, the meal that came with a $160 price tag for two was simply OK. \n\nFor the appetizer, I got the Lobster and Crab Cakes-pretty good. Drink, I chose a signature cocktail, Classic Manhattan, which was good and strong! My boyfriend and I both had Ceasar salads preceding our meals as well. The sides were a la carte and big enough to share. I got Lobster Mac N' Cheese and my boyfriend got Sam's Mashed Potatoes. There was entirely too much bread crumb drizzle over my mac n' cheese that I could have done without. \n\nNow for the entrees! You go to a steakhouse and expect the greatest steak ever.....guess again! I ordered the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream; its a 14 oz sirloin seasoned with black peppercorn for a spicy flavor. I asked for it to be prepared medium well, and the first cut was like I butchered and slaughtered it myself, bloody!!! I sent it back, it returned still too red in the center for my liking. So, before returning it again, I asked to make it well done to be on the safe side. That request was ignored, and it was brought back for the third time at the best attempt for medium well. I'm sure it lost some of its tenderness because of the back and forth attempts to cook it properly. The best thing about this steak was the seasoning and sauce drizzled over it. My boyfriend got the All-Natural Herb Roasted Chicken, which he neither raved or complained about. \n\nDessert, didn't get any, they were completely out of the little joy that may have brightened up this dinner for me. I wanted the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake....welp, maybe next time when I go for a cocktail and not a steak!","date":"2015-03-18 18:05:47"}

And I've had mediocre times at Ho Ho.  And about 50% of the items I order are the same, so I don't know why there is such a dramatic difference. It's always good but sometimes just lacks that extra something.\n\nI've ordered many of the things off the menu and will attempt to recount them all. We have had the Salt and Pepper Squid, the snow pea leaves, the roast pork, the roast duck, the barbecue pork, the vegetarian lo mein, the shrimp in tofu, the orange beef, the salty fish and chicken fried rice, the water cress, and some more but I can't recall which. The snow pea leaves were always good as are most of the options from the barbecue section. The lo mein was good but not extraordinary. I am not a fan of orange beef so when someone from my table wanted it, I hesitantly agreed. Since I was biased before we ordered it, I will not say it was good or bad. The salty fish fried rice was just the right amount of salty on the fish. The inconsistent things which disappoint me are the salt and pepper squid and the shrimp in tofu. Both were so good the first time I had them, and then, they tanked the second time. I don't know what happened but both weren't crispy despite being hot and fried.\n\nWould I come back, yea, but is it a gamble? Most likely.","date":"2012-11-06 03:50:51"}

It was easily the best Christmas present to myself. Although the process started back in November because I was just informed of their layaway plan thanks to a friend. Black Friday weekend she offered to put money down for me on them because I was stuck at work. \n\nI returned about a week later to see them in person and was acquainted with the JV crew. Ali helped me out with them but I discovered that my massive hulking calves weren't going to fit. :( *proceeded to cry bacon grease* But Ali assured me that not only does John have a tendency to make the calves small on his boots but they CAN be stretched. She also showed me a few other styles that I enjoyed but I still had my heart set on those tall distressed purple boots. She reccommended coming back in a skirt because my jeans were really thick but painted on. \n\nI came back on my next free day and was helped by Pete. He helped me get my massive calves into those boots. One thing I really appreciated about Pete was he was quite practical and not the slightest bit sharky. In fact, he talked me out of paying them off right then and there until after my reviews at school. Massart Alumni know what's up. \n\nSo I came back the following weekend after getting paid and school was finished to finalize the sale and start the stretching process which took a little under a week. The soft distressed leather stretched quite easily and they fit perfectly afterwards. I was also later helped out weather proofing them and given advice on general care. I could also change the soles out on an older pair of heels I had. Just overall amazing customer service! \n\nAlthough now every time I come in, I'm tempted into buying more shoes.

It could stand to have more lemony flavor, but as an iced tea, it's very good. I'm slightly less enamored with the punch they offer -- it's decent enough to buy, but it's missing something.

For those of you that are unfamiliar with the DDP it is a prepaid dining package that you can purchase if you are staying in a Walt Disney World resort. Essentially you pay for your meals in advance and if you are a crafty diner -like me- you can really get a lot of bang for your buck and end up saving some money in the long run. So take my review with a grain of salt because I went BIG at Artist Point and did so without regret. \n\nOf all the WDW eateries Artist Point is firmly entrenched in my top three. Artist Point gets huge bonus points for featuring an extensive wine selection from the under appreciated Pacific Northwest. I'm a pushover when it comes to a good wine pairing and always ask my server to match a glass to each course. Since they are trained in this and I am not I leave it to the professionals. \n\nI am a big fan of the artisan cheese course and like a typical American I treat this as an appetizer instead of an end of the meal treat. The trio of cheeses covers a safe yet broad selection of fromage including a nice cheddar, a creamy goat and a tangy blue. This was matched nicely with an Oregon Pinot Noir. \n\nThere are two dishes Artist Point is famous for; the cedar plank salmon and the buffalo. Choosing between these two wonderful dishes is almost a Sophie's Choice caliber decision. Of course if you know that Artist Point has an off the menu surf and turf option where you can have both you won't have to decide. It's kind of like getting your burger \"animal style\" at In-N-Out because unless you know to ask for it you wouldn't know it is there. Both dishes are wonderful and served in smaller portions when combined so you can enjoy both without being wasteful. \n\nDesserts leave a little to be desired at Artist Point. The signature berry cobbler just doesn't do it for me. The chocolate cheesecake and the clafouti (a rustic baked custard pie with fruit) are better choices.\n\nArtist Point is a popular restaurant so make sure yu contact Disney Dining for a priority seating time.","date":"2008-12-03 04:51:52"}

After all the glowing reviews about the good and the service, we were really excited to eat there.  We went in between 4 and 4:30 and there were no other diners there.  The server took our order and then she and the cook just hung around the front counter---he on his phone most of the time.  There seemed to be no action going on in the kitchen at all.  We ordered the dolmades for an appetizer and they were very good but tiny and overpriced at 5 for $6.95.  Then we waited and waited---still no action in the kitchen.  The server never checked on us.  Finally, the meal appeared (we are still the only diners In the place ). My daughters chicken kabob was so dry that she had to ask for some yogurt to dip it in and my little meat patties were so hard that I could hardly cut them.  Right before we were served we heard a timer go off, so considering the lack of action in the kitchen and the condition of the meat and chicken, I think they must have just reheated the entree.  The rest of the plate consisted of plain white rice and some garden salad greens with a basic vinaigrette dressing.  The server never came back after we were served.  When She brought the checkmentioned to her how dry the chicken was, she said--\"oh, really?\"  This was around $40.00 with tip and we left extremely unsatisfied.  Not worth the calories or the money.  It's hard to believe that we were in the same place with all the rave reviews about the food and service.\n\n\n\nThank you for your reply.  Evidently our experience was not the average because the reason we visited Troy was because of the good reviews.  That's why we were so surprised and disappointed by the unappetizing food and poor service.  I accept your explanation that the meat and chicken were cooked to order but, still, the chicken was extremely dry and the little meat patties were hard and tough.

But this is likely due to the fact that they don't fill you up in a large theatre.  Instead, every seat is a front row seat.

Initially, it feels \"cool\" to be flying over Canada, but after a while, the sensation disappears during the latter part of the show.   The one before the ride was probably not even necessary, as it was inferior is every way.  The picture AND sound quality were low. Even if you're standing, which most had to, one does not get that 360 feel. After about a minute into that segment, we realize there's not much need, or value, in rotating to see the other side of the room. \n\nThis all brings to the price charged.  At $22 per person, this was not a cheap thrill.  When you have a family or a group, it adds up quickly. \n\nIf you have never been across Canada, and you know you won't have time, then this may be worth it. Otherwise, there are better ways to spend the money - and time  (remember the line up) elsewhere.","date":"2016-10-13 22:48:24"}

The atmosphere is a bit nicer than the usual joints in this area, a place you don't have to warn people about before taking them here (date night perhaps?). The menu's pretty extensive and everything looked good, and I was intrigued by the 7 courses of fish and beef they had on offer as well as the wide variety of bubble tea and slushies. \n\nMy friends swear by the pho here, but I rarely deviate from Bun with Pork when I have Vietnamese (which is probably my favorite kind of pork EVER), and last night was no exception. One note is that Pho Hoa's Bun didn't have just pork as an option, so I had to go with the pork plus spring roll... I have no problems with the spring roll, it's kind of like getting a bonus app with your entree, but that extra fried bit tends to put me over the edge of fullness so I usually prefer just the pork option (plus the pork is my favorite part so the more of it I can get, the better). My Bun was delightful (it looked especially impressive here for some reason, the components were arranged so artfully), but I could have used a bigger container of nuoc cham, and also prefer my nuoc cham with slightly less red pepper flakes. But overall a solid tasty version with no major complaints from me, and comparable pricing to anywhere ($7.75). My dining companions of course really enjoyed their pho, and it did look good. Also, they served us cold tea, which was really refreshing on a hot summer day and a nice unique touch.\n\nService was spotty here though, they were good when we first arrived and our food came speedily, but we couldn't find anyone to initially take our order and then to get\/take our check, which was annoying. I'd say Pho Hoa is a solid choice when you're looking to be in a bit more upscale environment, but I don't plan on turning my back on Pho Pasteur any time soon.","date":"2011-05-27 14:03:38"}

This time was no different.\n\nI chose this spot from Grub Hub delivery.  My delivery options are quite limited in the new neighborhood so I couldn't believe my luck as I read the menu for this place.  I thought I must be dreaming as I read all of the delicious sounding items, and I triple checked to make sure they delivered.  Reasonably priced, and they were open. Great!  \n\nI place my order.  2 hours later, no food.  I call, and a young lady says that it's coming up now. Wth??! After I protest, she offers me a lemonade. Blank stare. Go figure.  Finally, about 20 minutes later, food arrives.\n\nHere's the kicker- the food was actually GOOD.  The breakfast potatoes I got were downright DELICIOUSLY spicy and tasty, with the bell peppers and onions perfectly grilled.  I had ordered a turkey and cheese with EXTRA mayo, lettuce, tomato, and ONION, CUT in HALF. They sent a sandwich with NO mayo and not cut.  I am very picky, hence the reason I take the time to very carefully specify how I would like my food prepared.  When it is nothing like I ordered, it signifies to me that I am not important enough for you to even care about TRYING to prepare my meal the way I asked (and paid) you to do it. FAIL.\n\nTurns out, the sandwich was very good, the bread was perfectly soft, but the lack of care in preparation means I'll NEVER have another one.  Plus, had I not had Hellman's in the fridge, we would have had a REAL problem, as I don't do sandwiches with no mayo. Period.\n\nThe owner called me when Grub Hub called her, and explained that she is a \"full service\" restaurant, and she does the delivery orders \"when she can fit them in\". Had this been my establishment, I would have comped this entire meal for goodwill, and offered to try and get it right on a different day, thus ensuring a second visit from a first time patron\/new neighbor\/potential regular (I eat out 6 of 7 days a week, most unfortunately).  Oh well.  Not my business.  I will offer this:  if you don't have the capacity to do delivery service, then you should not try to do delivery service.\n\nGood luck to you.","date":"2015-01-03 20:49:39"}

I will review my most recent which was this past Saturday night. The place was full and the staff seemed a little in the weeds. There is no host or hostess to greet you, so we stood there for a good 5 minutes before being ushered to our seats. So it's a small room, we *had* to have been seen before then, not to mention that my friends are two of the tallest people I know personally and there's no *way* they weren't spotted! We were a party of 4 with a reservation which we were about 5 minutes late for - oopsie. I'm sure that's somehow my fault. Once seated, it took some time to be approached to give our drink order (another 7 minutes or so), and once we gave that order, it became painfully clear that a hostess was not the only staff member they were missing. There is no bartender there, and one of the waiters? the busboy? made the drinks. Which were quite tasty, but took over 10 minutes to get to us. I was beginning to wish I ordered wine instead of a Pineapple Martini (but I loooooove Skyy Pineapple, so I *had* to). So, we've been here for 20 minutes already and are just getting our drinks. The busboy did serve us water, which I drank right away and was not refilled. Even when asked. \n\nThe waiter was apologetic, but seemed to shuffle the blame off onto the busboy, and I'm not certain that everything was that poor kid's fault. In any event, we ordered our food, appetizers came out within a reasonable time (I loved my tomato, gorgonzola salad, and wish I had some right now). My dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs as well. But then there was a huge lag before the entrees. Like more than a half an hour, which goes by even more slowly when the drinks are being made by Slowy McSlowerson. And still no water! They brought more bread though, which I know tickled one of my DCs. \"You mean the bread started tickling him??\" No - it's a figure of speech, sheesh! When the food did arrive, the pasta e fagiole I ordered seemed bland (my Mom used to make it with salt pork for a nice meaty, slightly smoky flavor). This one lacked seasoning so I had to put a fair amount of salt and cheese on it to make it palatable. My friend ordered the chicken broccoli and ziti but wanted the homemade fusili instead which they goofed on and forgot. They did realize their mistake, though, and offered a free dessert. My other dining companions seemed pleased with their food (one ordered a veal marsala that I did not try and the other - my favorite - ordered off the menu, actually, a request they were kind enough to accommodate - it was gnocchi caprese with pesto sauce instead of tomato sauce, and it was gooeyyummydelicious)! \n\nThis is not a good place to go to if you're \"fungry\" or will get cranky because you haven't eaten all day before showing up. At least not on the weekend. The weeknight experience I had with my favorite DC was quite different as the service wasn't scattered or slow. I'll go back there, because of the value and convenience ($150.00 before tip for 4 people, all of whom drank alcohol and got plenty of food), but perhaps not on a weekend, and perhaps not to order the pasta e fagiole again. They were friendly and I always like to go to a non-chain, small, family-owned place.","date":"2010-10-05 19:03:23"}

Their drinks were expensive and their side dishes suck (beans and tofu slices). You had to order side dishes to get drinks( milk teas). I recommend not getting side dishes. They are tasteless.

I am a huge animal fan and for anyone else who is, you MUST stay at either the Animal Kingdom Lodge or the Villas within the lodge.\n\nNothing is more amazing then stepping out on your balcony and seeing animals. We had a balcony with a pool view that had luscious greenery abound with some animals in the distance. If you stay here, or even if you just go for a meal at Sanaa, Jiko or Boma, take a walk around the property! That's an order! Outdoors is absolutely beautiful. It is so fun going around checking everything out from the animals roaming around to the cool rockers placed around the firepit. They read stories some evenings. Also, when night falls, be sure to go to the night viewing spot and check out the animals with the night vision googles. It's a lot of fun!\n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful as well. The lobby is magnificent with amazing decor throughout. Get a tour of the AKL if you can!  There are super comfy chairs everywhere. We relaxed while waiting for a Boma dinner one evening in the couches, just taking in the atmosphere. There are some comfy chairs around an indoor fireplace which my friend actually fell asleep in front of as I was reading the story behind it. Plus, there are a couple of big balconies that overlook animal viewing areas which make for some fun!\n\nWe stayed in a Studio Villa which was huge! It had everything we could need...free Wi Fi (this is villas only), coffee maker, microwave, sink, fridge, all the mini kitchen fixens. We had our big bed plus a nice couch, table, flat screen tv, tons of space for the two of us. Plus, I loved the Animal themeing to the rooms (I will post pictures). The beauty was in the details of the room and hidden Mickeys were abound!\n\nI loved Boma their 1 TS restaurant, Jiko their 2 TS restaurant is simply amazing, I haven't yet tried Sanaa, and Mara their quick service area is great as well. \n\nThe pool is so beautiful! It's as if it's plopped write in the middle of Animal Kingdom---trees and greenery everywhere!\n\nThey have the usual great Disney staff throughout. I love their gift shop, as well! \n\nThe only downfall is it's one of the few Disney Deluxe Hotels that you have to take a bus everywhere.

Plan to spend a half-hour or so just chatting with the knowledgeable staff and tasting the salts; it will be time well-spent and an amazing, broadening education.\n\nThey also have an amazing selection of chocolate both for direct eating and also for cooking.  This comprehensive selection -- doubtlessly the best in Portland -- includes some world-class entries.  \n\nThis is the sort of store that America needs about two of, one in New York and the other in... hmmm... LA?  San Francisco?  We can be very thankful that the second (actually, the first) is in Portland.  This store is a very important culinary resource for Portland.","date":"2013-04-10 20:57:50"}

The eggs are local and farm fresh, the potatoes were perfectly seasons (not too salty), and the fruit was fresh.  \n\nThe second time was with my boyfriend and his two friends from Seattle.  Our wait time was about 20 minutes (also discovered that they have self serve coffee on the bar for you to enjoy while you wait) and got a table out on the patio area and got to enjoy the sunshine (although it should be noted that due to the flowers that are outside, there are a few bees flying in the area).  This time I ordered the Shredded Smoked Pork Benedict (if you can't tell, I like eggs benedict) and once again, I enjoyed it very much!

He and his team work to create the best dining experience possible. The tasting is $85; we also opted for the drink pairing $45. There were 13 courses that were paired with four wines and two beers. \n\nThey take pride in working with local farmers and ranchers to create small plates using fresh seasonal ingredients. As a result, the menu is ever-changing. \n\nOur first trio of plates, were paired with L'Conti Brut\/Blanquette de Limoux\/France. \n\nFunyuns and caviar, such a perplexing first bite. We were in for a treat.Pimento, this might just be the perfect hors-d'oeuvre. I could eat these all day. Beet Trifle with grilled mushroom and blue cheese cookie. This was oddly delicious. \n\nThe next pairing was Adelbert's Philosophizer Saison\/Austin. We were hooked from the first sip.\n\nYellowtail, carrot, pistachio miso, caramel - I thought anticipated this dish as a favorite, it was enjoyable but one of my least favorite of night.Morel, avocado - earthy, rich and perfectly creamy.\n\nThe next two dishes were paired with 2013 Weingut Robert Weil Trocken\/Rheingau,Germany.\n\nScrambled egg, crawfish boil. This was positively scrumptious. More, please!Carbonara, I adore it when chefs play with food. Squid noodles and all the flavor of a carbonara.\n\nThe next wine was 2011 Gerard Bertrand \"Grand Terroir\" Tautavel Blend\/Cotes du Roussilion, France.Radish, pork fat, smoked cashew - a wonderful surprise of flavors.Duck, radiccio, loquat - this was another dish, I expected to standout, but it was also a least favorite.\n\nOur last wine of the evening was 2013 Franco Espanolas Diamante\/ Rioja, Spain.\n\nSunchoke cereal, was the most unusual dish. It reminded me of Cocoa Pebbles, I mean that in the best way.Chamomile, berries - This was the best dessert that I can recollect. The berries had such intense flavor it was incredible! I ate my husband's too.\n\nThe final pairing was Prearis Quadrupel\/Belgium.Mesquite bean, chocolate - This play on the churro was very yummy, but I gave mine to the husband after a taste since I wanted to savor the berries from the last dessert.\n\nWe were blown away. It was a phenomenal meal and service was top notch. My two least favorite dishes were still wonderful, but they were familiar.

Loved the concept before I actually tasted anything - a very interesting variety of gourmet burgers - pate burger, po-boy burger, etc.  But the majority of burgers (we sampled most of them that they were serving that night, roughly 6 different ones) missed the mark on this night.  \n\nApparently the burgers will range from $6 to $50 for a kobe burger, and I think paying more than $10 for any of the burgers I tried would be unsatisfying.  The choice of sides that night were fries, onion rings, Caesar salad and a curry type of cauliflower thing.  I really liked the cauliflower, but others at my table didn't.  The Caesar dressing on the salad had no taste.  The buns were the same on all the burgers and they were nothing special about them.  I would have loved a  thinner bun with some toasty\/crispiness to it, whereas theirs were pretty fluffy\/oily\/bready.\n\nRichard Blaise, while present behind the bar sporadically, did not speak to any of the diners while I was there, which I thought was pretty rude for a \"friends and family\" pre-opening.

When the third waitress told us to take a seat yet again, my fiance simply said \"I don't see any that are open\" to which we both got a \"ugh, whatever\" pissed off look before waitress number three stormed off.

We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. \n\nWe call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying \"master of excellence\". I'm sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesn't have physical space to display that.\n\nHe tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN we'll talk price.\n\nLet's pause for a minute. Suppose you're a Honda dealer and you honestly don't have a relatively popular car. Wouldn't you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, don't you? Of course, you would. Either he didn't have a car or he knew he didn't want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.\n\nSo he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess it's working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didn't stop. He called me like 8 times and I didn't answer.\n\nWe went to that other place the same day and bought the car. \n\nIn summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Don't ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesn't mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply don't know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.\n\nHere's a more detailed account of our buying process: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw","date":"2011-07-28 15:24:41"}

As we entered we were asked if we had reservations and I replied we did not. Long pause from the hostess... I finally perked up and said...can we still eat? She said of course and seated us in the quaint dining room which has 3 other tables with guest in it. The service went up from there...and our server was friendly and engaged and offered her personal suggestions and listened intently as she chatted up the other tables as well. We settled on the Shrimp Bruschetta as an appetizer, I odered the scallops and my Significant Other chose the buttermilk fried chicken. \n\nThe Shrimp Bruschetta I was a little disappointed with; one large hunk of bread with some sauce and shrimp left with the tails on did not impress me. It was awkward for two people to eat. I felt like the flavors did not complement each other and I personally do not want to pick through my appetizer to cut the tails off the shrimp. \n My Significant Other liked his Chicken though I found it to be just okay for their signature dish. My scallops were very good and light with the butternut squash.\nI had pondered the dessert menu the from the second I got there and so many things looked so good I could not decide. I went with the Drunken Cherry Bread pudding with Buttermilk ice cream. I am not sure what the Cherry was drunken in...cause I could not taste it. The dessert was light and I would have preferred it a tad sweeter or more tart.

Unfortunately, then we come to the major downside: the food. The first note was good, the chips being excellent (tasted like the were made in-house). The salsa was good, though nothing outstanding. However, for the main I got beef enchiladas with red salsa ( they were out of green salsa, along with half a dozen other menu items, but I'll chalk that up to opening weekend wrinkles to iron out).

Please understand that I'm talking about a very simple, 1-item order which would have normally taken only a couple of minutes to prepare.\n\nIndeed, what should have been a quick in\/out experience ends up lasting 10-15 minutes. And, when you're the only customer in her store, you're acutely aware that you just don't rate.\n\nTo make matters worse, when you ask Celine to put a little extra mayonnaise on your sandwich, she instead hands you a small To Go container of mayonnaise so that you have to inconveniently add it yourself. I don't know whether to call these transgressions poor business practices, or just plain rudeness.\n\nLest you think I'm being too harsh on Celine, this same sad event has happened to me twice only weeks apart.\n\nBelow is a list of my individual star ratings by category.

Known for their breakfast and lunch, but I was able to sneak in a quick early dinner at 5:30pm, before they shortly close at 6pm. How unfortunate, because parking is a lot easier to locate after 6pm. \n\nBut nonetheless, lets get to the food aspect:\nOrdered the simple basic omurice. Was good. Egg was nicely pan fried, but was still left moist. I guess I would've prefered it if it was a tad bit more fluffy. Taste was there, but of course a bit bland, but thats where you have fun with your ketchup! Omurice, isn't omurice without your ketchup design :) Underneath the nice plain egg, is your lightly fried and flavored rice, with edamame beans. I think the mixture of the rice and plain omurice goes well together. And what an omurice should be like :)\n\nPortions are a bit small for us, greedy westernized folks. But really.. thats the portion we should eat on a regular basis. Plus its only ~$7. :)\n\nOrdered the Macha Latte. Its literally.. Warm milk with macha powder. Very strong macha flavor. Not sweet, wish they added a whee bit of sugar or honey (maybe i'm just too accustomed to the overly sweet green tea latte at starbucks). \n\nOverall: Cute and delicious!

What more do you need?\n\nWhether or not this place is an authentic Spanish joint is not the point; Eclipse serves such a wide variety of tapas that the important thing is that you'll find something here for everyone. \n\nMy personal suggestions would be the pan catalan, which are strips of crusty ciabatta with something that looks like Cheez Whiz but is actually a tomato and thyme pur√©e -- it never fails to get first-timers into the tapas-style meals. \n\nThe Costilla ribs are also excellent, roasted in aged balsamic to perfect softness. And if you're a seafood nut, you'll go crazy for the paella negra. The dark, inky color can be a bit off-putting, but tasty nonetheless. Make sure to order it first thing, since it takes 35 minutes to cook. \n\nNaturally, the sangria is a MUST. I've been here three times in the past month and the sangria has been on point each time. Mojitos are another good option. Once dinner is over, head a few store up to Cafe Intermezzo to finish off a very European night.\n\nA few downsides: lighting is too dark, far too loud on salsa nights, inconsistent service from servers who are dressed way too casually in the festive atmosphere, and the extensive menu, which can be a plus, but not when you have Anglos in your party who cannot pronounce Spanish words to save their life.","date":"2009-03-02 05:22:24"}

I apologize for length. \n\nI am dropping Potbelly a  couple stars based on our experience Monday. 2.5\n\nI really wanted to go to Whole Foods for a burger. ( different review but their burgers are solid: Sustainable, organic, delicious. )\n\nMom, said Princess, I really want broccoli soup and a milkshake. \n\nOk. Potbelly I guess. ( not excited about forfeiting the burger but she wants broccoli after days of only wanting pho. And I mean days). I couldn't promise broccoli soup at Whole Foods. They rotate their soups. \n\nIts 2pm. The parking lot is pretty empty. Its Veteran's Day.Usually this lot is nuts.  Theres a handful of people outside at tables and just a couple inside. .We stumble in to give our order to the girl at the counter. I order the chocolate shake first ( because it takes the longest ), then the bowl of soup, then a chicken salad sandwich on wheat( \"multigrain\" she says) then pick up some pop chips and head to the register. \n\nMa'am? What sandwich did you order again?\n\nChicken salad. \n\nOh ok. She says. \n\nAt the register my sandwich is sitting on the counter next to a tray (?) And I say \" is this mine ? And he nods so I pick it up and put it on the tray while he rings it up, then he notes the pop chips, reminds milkshake maker to get the shake and  says  \" a bowl of soup\" and as he rings it up says \" we are out of broccoli soup\" and \"you can have garden veggie or southwest chicken.\" He asks my daughter, \"do you want to taste them? \"\n\nUm no, says Princesses' facial expression, there are ONIONS in those. ONIONS are from Satan. Lets be real, neither of those choices is particularly kid friendly unless a parent has made them knowing what the kid will tolerate or if the kid had no food issues whatsoever. I don't have that kid. Mutely, pretty sad really, she shakes her head. She whispers to me \"I don't have to eat.\"\n\nGrrrrr.Really?! Then he goes and erases broccoli cheese  soup from their board. \n\nIf,  when I had ordered broccoli cheese soup, the girl had said \" we are out\" ...I would have said ok thanks and left. Or even better if I hadn't seen it on the board, I wouldn't have even had to talk to them! ( I do this at Fresh Thyme soup quite a bit. Go in, see what's left on their board...they're good at updating...and leave if nothing left will work). \n\nI couldn't do that now because I had a sandwich. Not a burger. Sigh. \n\nThe helpful register man gave us a free cookie to make up for being out of soup at 2pm. So my child had a milkshake ( which she ended up not drinking btw), a cookie we gave her dad later, and my chips that have less nutrition than dirt. I had a sandwich I didn't enjoy. This was not a successful lunch. \n\nAfterwards I took her to Java Mama's for a bagel. I needed coffee. \n\nWill we go back? \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe not for soup. \n\nWhat a wasted trip to Potbelly. It is cheap. But...they need to tighten up their ship a bit.\n \n*Disclaimer: The Princess, by royal edict, is not eating sandwiches currently unless its grilled cheese.","date":"2013-11-14 16:36:01"}

No wait, great food, questionable (but still pleasant) service. \nThe hostess was super nice and very easy on the eyes. The waitress we got was one of (or more) of the following:  brand new; confused; having a horrible day; confused; a disaster; confused....you get it.  At the very least, she was pleasant about everything that was screwed up: didn't know the 5 beers (or so) on tap; brought a wrong drink; gave wrong drinks to different people at my table; didn't bring any condiments or potato fixins; disappeared after the food was delivered; immediately after eating brought 5 separate bills to the table, one for each person, without asking if we wanted separate checks (we didn't) or asking us if we wanted any other drink, coffee, or dessert (we did)...again, you get the point. \nOutside of the service, the food was actually quite good. Maybe try eating in the bar area. They did have live music and a decent vibe there, or so it seemed. I recommend the shrimp bisque.

Avoiding the long wait list, we sat at the astonishingly available bar, on seriously comfortable stools. There was plenty of space for the many condiments breakfast requires and we had lots of elbow room. My friend was pleased with her selection of bagel and accouterments, salad and a consistent spinach mushroom omelet. I almost always go for a farmer type breakfast, eggs, bacon etc. With a choice on the potatoes, I went with the hash browns, rather than the polenta or roasted potatoes. They were cooked to perfection and a perfect amount, not overloading the plate or skimpy, either. The eggs were a perfect over very easy and the generous portion of bacon was crispy and tasty. The service was close to excellent, and the only real drawback was the fact it was so crowded, things were slower than I suspect they usually are.

However, our last several visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices, and we're at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant.  This has caused a great disturbance in the force!  Hard to imagine we'll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be.\n\nOur visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general:  We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open, and one table was also vacant.  However, dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces, so no seating was available.  We sat on the waiting bench for 15 minutes (!) watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention.  Finally, one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes, and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter.  \n\nWhen we sat down, my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped, and a lot of it.  The bits of rice were especially sticky, so it was hard to overlook, and once we glanced down, our appetites diminished.  It appeared that food had been accumulating all day, as it was a dirty mess underneath the table.  The supplies at the table itself were all out, aside from ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce was empty, no sauce dishes, and none at any adjacent places, either.  To her credit, one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements.  \n\nThat was the one bright spot, though:  Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly, and we had to ask where they were before they showed up.  The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day, at least judging by their manner, and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby--not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish!  When we paid, the waitress at the register didn't say a word, no smile or thank you, no word at all, and I felt bad about having left a tip.  We feel that servers should be treated generously, but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired!\n\nOn the whole, this was really not a good experience, and in keeping with each of our recent visits.  I don't know if ownership has changed, or someone just stopped caring, but the place seems run by kids who don't know or care about cleanliness and customer service.  So sad to see our favorite restaurant come to this end.","date":"2012-06-25 23:54:20"}

I'd say the most annoying thing is when you are reminded that this place is not just a safe haven for students, but also open to everyone else.

Although everything was amazing the home fries are more like hashbrowns, but they are still fantastic. Mimosas are $3 and well worth it. They aren't too weak and too strong; perfection! I wish they served poinsettia (champagne and cranberry juice), but the server said they don't have them...no biggie I just drank up on the $3 mimosas :-) I'll defiantly want to come back again and again. I love wine and since they are a wine bar, I plan to come back for that! Also, since I love to eat, I also want to try their dinner menu!

It's all subjective depending on the difficulty, but there needs to be more communication about additional charges etc. Their website has a few details, but if you're looking for a more customized set I would definitely request a quote or something next time. I came in to use their nail printer (that I found out about via IG!) but the result wasn't that great - I used a personal image that I sent beforehand, and it the result wasn't what I was expecting. I wish there had been a little more communication about what kinds of pics yield the best results because I would have brought more options then.\n\nI also had some simple nail art done - highly skilled artists that gave me exactly what I was looking for, but paid just over $100 for a relatively \"simple\" set (no charms or crazy nail art) which was a little surprising.

Although, this is my first choice iHop to visit, I'm not sure why its always packed. It doesn't matter what time of day you go here on a Saturday - whether its raining or snowing, be prepared to wait.  This time we had Mario who regrettably forgot about us. We sat in by the window so it was cool, we had the chance to people-watch as we chatted a bit about the current news. I've been here countless times.  A time when we got the new guy who had no idea what he was doing but we were patient. Another time when the manager came over to tease my bf about a Falcon's hat he was wearing.  Another time when the manager didn't even remember who he was. That was funny. Another time when we had to approach the manager about an issue. But THIS time was something different.  Anyway what brought me to write this review was because of the celebrity spotting - AmberRose...not to be confused with Yeezy's ex Amber Rose, not Whiz Khalifa's baby's momma Amber Rose, not the Amber Rose that refers to her Twitter followers as RoseBuds but Amber Rosario - or something like that. I heard the voice of a sweet southern girl who introduced herself to her table - \"Hi, Im AmberRose and I will be your server today...\" All I could see in front of me was my bf laughing, then he covered his face. I turn to my left \"OH, OK!\" and quickly turned my head before she could see that I was chuckled a bit. It was funny and cute at the same time. She was so sweet. I honestly wished that she was serving us because she would've given us the hookup on some extras if you know what I mean. Even if you don't, you have to go see for yourself.\n\nBesides that Mario was cool. I usually get upset when I'm ignored by my waiter but I didn't even see him walking around. I had so much fun that morning that it didn't even phase me.\n\nThe food is always cooked to perfection and it comes out quickly. I always get exactly what I order. I'm really picky about my eggs. I prefer shelled eggs - or country style eggs as they like to call them. I don't care if they're country or city. I want them out of a shell. The pancakes are always good. Although they slip on the hot syrup sometimes, all you had to do is ask and they'll bring it right to you.  The price is reasonable. You may catch a special every now and then. Other than that the staff is great and the atmosphere is homely. \n\nTry this iHop but remember, do not come extremely hungry. There's always a wait.","date":"2013-05-28 20:51:32"}

I ordered the #9 - the noodles with lamb. I was quite happy with the thick meaty fresh noodles and the combination of cilantro, raw onions and small bits of lamb, but (and this is a major but) it was way too oily, especially the last of the noodles as they were swimming in a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl. I liked the noodles so much I still finished my meal with a grimace.  I think the next table had a better idea and left a few noodles behind. My stomach was still working on the food 9 hours later and I wasn't hungry for that time, which was strange because I'm the kind of person who eats every few hours. Anyway, I got there after 1pm but the line was still long so prepare for a wait. Gene seemed to be an affable fellow though and I appreciate the specialness of the noodles and I think I would come back again if only he made it much less oily!","date":"2013-08-15 16:59:38"}

Elbow out the meat eaters or come early. Bring the dogs. Almost all the menu items are adaptable to vegan without compromise. For example they have vegan cheese and avocado so when you veganize an item you don't give up several essential toppings and pay the same price as omnis. At breakfast the \"how latin\" is the major winner, with tofu and vegan sausage, wonderful but oiley sauce, black bean mango salsa, extra toast because the biscuit is not vegan, and vegan cheese grits. At $9 is also among the best values in portland. No more nickle and diming vegans to sub cheaper ingredients that their carnivorous counterparts. Don't forget about dinner, they have a happy hour where you can get a vegan quesadilla or tacos for $4 and a beer for $3.  This place trumps vita for vegan alberta st breakfast, and is the winner for vegan dinner on the street as well. Don't sleep in and get slammed with a wait with all the omnis, go early and bring your dogs, it will be a great experience.  They open at 7am and there is never a wait till about 8:30ish. The only downside is that they don't have soy creamer for the coffee, so if you don't drink your coffee black you may be a little disappointed, i just drink my coffee or tea before going.

It'd been 3 years since seeing a dentist and I wanted to start getting back on track. Staff was nice, but very busy. Got x-rays, had an exam with a hygienist, all was fine. The dentist then came in, looked at my x-rays and my permanent retainers (top and bottom) and said that he wanted to take the retainers out. Okay, that was fine, I was interested. The only problem, he said, was that due to shorter roots on one of my lower incisors, I was likely to lose a tooth. This apparently didn't faze him.\n\nHe started talking about bridges and implants, then asked if I knew what a veneer was. I said no, and he directed the nurse to show me a video on it, then left. With no further explanation, I was forced to watch a video of a veneer being installed, in extreme close-up. If you don't know what a veneer is, it's when your teeth are all ground down and they install 3\/4 crowns on all of your teeth. Watching teeth being ground down is basically a scene from a horror movie. I was pretty appalled. Following that, they showed me an estimate for the removal of the permanent retainers (fairly inexpensive), a bridge (very expensive), and a night guard (very expensive), totaling nearly $4k. I left, shaken and convinced that I was going to lose a tooth and a LOT of money.\n\nI ended up getting a second opinion at Conway Dental Care (to which I have now transferred). The dentist there asked if I had any pain (something the dentist at Bright Now didn't bother asking), and I said no. \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\" he said, after inspecting the retainers to make sure they actually weren't broken. He said that I just need to come in for a regular cleaning and they'll be fine. This was an immense relief that my new dentist didn't pressure me into getting a needless procedure that risks losing my teeth!\n\nTLDR: Be careful with Bright Now - while the people who work there are plenty nice, the dentist will likely recommend unnecessary procedures without regard to your comfort, just to make a buck. Beware of large clinics. Get second opinions when you can.\n\nAlso: I can't speak to the quality of their work, as I have not had any work done here, just got scared off by their consultation.","date":"2016-10-26 15:23:36"}

When I went with The Boy, I was excited because the space is small and the recognizable Korean Omma which usually is a sign of good food ahead!\n\nKaju's menu isn't elaborate, definitely straight-to-the-point. Soft tofu, clay pots, BBQ, a few appetizers and then what they call a 'special menu' that consists of fairly typical Korean fare like Bibimbap, Ttokbokki, Panjeon. I took photos of the menu since there can't be one found online (besides for the now-Closed Cambridge location).\n\nI ordered the Hot Stone Bulgogi soup which was just average to me. Definitely had the sweetness of bulgogi but was lacking any depth. I did enjoy the glass noodles though and felt it could've used a little more tender meat and less scallions\/veggies.\n\nThe Boy enjoyed his Spicy Pork BBQ but portions here are pretty small for the price. If you're going to pay this much, might as well go to Seoul Soulongtong where the portions are much larger for the same dollar and they have a few more authentic Korean offerings.","date":"2017-12-16 00:49:23"}

I was having a similar difficulty getting the name to pop up on Yelp! Anyway we arrived @ 5 pm on a Thursday to an almost empty but relatively cozy restaurant. Funky but interestingly decorated I felt comfortably ready to enjoy a fusion experience. My wife selected our choice for our dining experience & in my desire to walk into the unknown I lead the way.\nOur arrival was just before the masses of reserved patrons & their dinner times. I tried to get reservations but the earliest was 9:30 pm & me being of the morning person persuasion I'm usually putting one foot into the sack by that time!\nMy call for a reservation was rewarded with the valuable info that if we showed up early we could sit at the bar in front of the chefs preparing dinner...kinda like a sushi bar. The \"waiter \/ mater d\" was very friendly & attentive and provided us the lunch menu (since we were early) and the drink menu with the soon to be ready dinner menu...we got the big spectrum treatment. My li'l woman ordered a sake mojito (darn good but a touch more octane would have been nice) and I ordered a caraf of chilled junmai sake with the green papaya slaw w\/ chili, peanuts, lime & cilantro...noted w\/ 3 stars as HOT!  I'm a seasoned chili pepper enthusiast  or \"chilihead\" & found it mild to my palate. Our waiter brought me some of the Thai chilis that they use just to \"sweeten the deal\" and I grew happier as the experience progressed...yes the sake helped too.\nDinner came quickly and we ordered the wok-roasted mussels ...ooooh yeah they were awesome as we're the Taiwanese Dan Dan noodles then came the steamed bao... oooooh so gooood! If I had less control & more room I could have gone further but restraint prevailed. I was very content and so glad we came thru the rain and hurddles to experience the wonderful food and the passion @ which it was prepared for us. The staff was friendly, helpful and informative so this restaurant has my fondness & support so I recommend you get yourself in there and have a good time!","date":"2012-06-26 01:29:21"}

I said, yes, tacos is good! \n\nWe pulled up to bartaco,  and it was time for tacos. We entered the rather clean establishment and a confused gentleman greeted us. I overlooked his awkwardness,  and he walked us to a cute little table. I loved the cruise ship decor, I was pretty impressed, I was in paradise.

I looked up from my menu, and my sister and a handsome gentleman walked my way. He introduced himself, and he apologized for the inconvenience. You know what, he had me at, hello! I love good customer service. Christoph was an excellent ending to a rocky beginning. Christoph explained the menu etc, and he gave us tacos on the house. He left us in good hands as well. \n\nOur waitress Aimee was a breath of fresh air.\n\nAimee took our order. I ordered fried oyster, shrimp, falafel, and the lobster taco.

While Columbus Brewing Company is slightly off the beaten path (tucked away in - appropriately - the Brewery District), that's where it gets a bit of its charm. It is somewhat of a secret to those who dare not divert from the safe routes of High Street, Olentangy and Lane Avenues. \n\nWhile the roads there may not be so dazzling, the restaurant itself has a fantastic decor and an amazing menu that is surprising and fun. Why choose the Columbus Brewing Company? If you're looking for the best locally brewed craft beer, look no further. Columbus Brewing Company offers more than 6 different beers (certain beers available only during certain seasons). My suggestion? Get the SAMPLER and taste all of the beers in all of their glory:\n\nThe Columbus Apricot Ale and the 1859 Porter range from light and fruity to dark and hoppy, respectively. There's a beer for all personalities. I once visited in March 2010 in which the seasonal beer of the month was the \"Arnold\" in celebration of the Arnold Fitness Classic. It got its namesake by the very strong hoppy bite it had...I wish it were around all year, but that's why it's fun to go back and see what new beers they have.\n\nThe place gets 5 stars not on its beer alone. Its food is all around fantastic. I couldn't decide between the sweet teriyaki calamari or the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, so at the suggestion of our amazingly friendly and helpful waitress, I got BOTH and still couldn't tell you which is tastier!\n\nFor dinner, my suggestions are the Caribbean style burrito (it comes with mouth watering plantains that everyone should try at least once in their life) and the pulled pork sandwich (I don't recall its name specifically, but it's darn good!). \n\nI never had room for dessert here at the CBC, but wouldn't doubt that it too is great. \n\nCome here to get a true taste of Columbus and some of the best service around. Don't forget to wash down your meals with a beer sampler if you're 21!\n\nPS: Also came here for a Christmas\/\/holiday party for work and had the staff come around with small horsdoeuvres...all great!","date":"2010-07-07 20:29:59"}

It's a pretty small store for the chain concept and possibly great for those looking to experiment with Korean food if they haven't tried it before to get a taste but too afraid to go all in at a Korean restaurant. \n\nWe tried a variety of things and my favorite was the wings (half and half) and the takoyaki (octopus balls). We tried other things such as the pork buns and korean tacos. The pork buns pork belly was very thin and that was disappointing compared to the photo on the menu. Imagine the width and length of a pinky finger. Yup. Then, we chose bulgolgi for the Korean Taco which was easy to eat and okay. The Takoyaki was crispy on the outside but still soft and warm on inside. \n\nLastly, the wings. I thought the size was great. It's not too big or small for what I consider normal. I thought it was crispy and crunchy enough but not too hard. We got the half and half which is the spicy and soy. \n\nOverall, its a okay choice for a casual lunch or dinner.

We walked in and James, the owner, said he could do it while we waited. He also found a broken spoke, so after explaining to me what spokes are for (turns out it's for more than just holding the spokeos...), he fixed that, too. I've been bike commuting for about 5 years, but I still have much to learn and he was friendly and helpful while explaining things. We were back on the road fast. A week later, 5 minutes into my ride, my rear tube blew out. I was close, so I just walked it down to the shop. Again, James fixed it while I waited and as we talked he realized that he may have been responsible for the pinching of the tube that caused my flat in the first place. He said it was possible that the new tire install the previous week had left the tube pinched and vulnerable, so he fixed the flat without a charge.

My son has fun during each class and shows noticeable development with his milestones afterward.  I have never had a problem with communication from the Grow and Sing staff. I received multiple emails and texts about the 4th of July week being off for example. They send all material and much of the music and sounds ahead of time which helps with repeated exposure and the kids can continue to learn once the class has ended (think of it like reading before class during college). They are quite flexible about missing a class as long as you try to let them know ahead of time and they do allow make-up classes.

So walking in I expected nothing but Denny's quality. Wrong I was!\n\nWhen we walked in the hostess was very friendly and hip. The interior isn't anything to write home about but the counter stools in one area have a nostalgic feel along with the checkerboard floor. A huge blackboard with daily specials covers one wall. On the table were thin paper placemats covered with ads. A throwback, yes, but kinda cheap and tacky. Super cold inside for me. Needed a sweater by my dining companion was absolutely fine. \n\n Overall, the service was friendly but a little too friendly (not like that!) meaning too much socializing at one table for quite awhile and neglecting ours when we needed more napkins. (The napkins they had were super cheap and useless pretty much. Plus there aren't any dispensers at the tables so ask for extra when you get your food. ) Then ten minutes after we ordered, the server came back and said they were out of English muffins. Should have known that sooner but to our surprise someone had gone over to a nearby Publix to buy some!! You've now got a customer for life!\n\nFriend ordered Eggs Benedict while I tried the chicken and waffles (how could I not?) Friend really liked his and the hash browns had the perfect ratio of crispiness. My dish was huge and could feed two people. Fried chicken was great and the waffles nice and airy. Didn't care for the strawberry butter that came with it as it left an aftertaste. My server did introduce me to the proper way to dip my chicken--hot sauce mixed with syrup. Nice and different and it grew on me. \n\nFabulous food, local dive-like feel and the best part about this was being surprised that the original Metro Diner which began in Jax was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives!!

The real gem in my opinion are the cakes for dessert.  Their carrot cake is the best I have had since moving to Georgia from Texas a year ago.  We get it every time we come here.  Many folks also say the coconut cake is wonderful.  They usually have 5 or 6 different types each evening.  \n\nThe only thing I will say is, don't come here if in a hurry.  This is a very laid back place and they do not bring out the food quickly.  This is a place to sit a while visit with friends or family, and eat and drink like folks do in Europe.  The service is very friendly and attentive while you wait.\n\nAlso, once a month they have live jazz, which is a nice touch.  The music was quite good when we caught it a couple months back.","date":"2016-01-30 01:38:14"}

Double meat, cheese, size, dressing, etc... \nThey are an assembly line of sandwich preparing. One person starts it, passes it to someone else who passes it down again.

This was, without doubt, the best Italian meal I've eaten in Portland. To contextualize at the risk of sounding pretentious, this is Italian food as served in Italy, rather than \"American Italian\" food, which is really a spin on nineteenth century regional (southern) Italian food with ingredient substitutions based on what was available to impoverished immigrants on the Lower East Side. Emphasis here seems to be on selecting superb quality fresh ingredients and putting them together in interesting and mildly experimental ways. I've never eaten better spinach than that which formed the base of my spinach salad, neither eaten a more comforting dish of gnocchi anywhere west of Sorrento. Just what the doctor ordered on a 20 degree Portland evening. I tend to benchmark Italian restaurants by the quality of the gnocchi; here served with pesto and crisp pancetta; just perfect.\n\nThe service was very friendly and helpful, but a little slow. They comped my wife's cocktail when it arrived a course too late. The ambience is really wonderful, reminds me of little restaurants in my home town of Brighton, bijou, full of character and knick-knacks. Intimate, homely and relaxed.\n\nWill definitely come back.","date":"2011-03-02 20:54:24"}

Stayed here on a whim because the description looked so promising. So many pools, so much to do, so many activities. This is a time share resort where they want very much to sell you ownership, and these places and their high pressure sales techniques always leave me uncomfortable. \n\nThe place is so huge that it ought to have its own zip code. The streets are narrow, so there appears to be even more cars and bodies around. Check in time is at 4pm. Then you get taken to the overly friendly time share salesperson, who invites you to breakfast and won't take no for an answer. They extract $20 from you to make sure you show up. (After seeing the place, I sacrificed my $20.)  Finally, a bellman has you follow his golf cart in your car to find your room. By that time, it's 5pm. \n\nWe were excited to bring the kids to play on the 18 hole putt putt course right on property. Sounds much better than it is. However, when we got to the club rental place, they told us all equipment had to be back by 5:15pm. We had 6 minutes if we cared to use them. Of course, checkout time is 10am. Which us fine if you want to get to the parks, but means you have to get up at the crack of dawn to use the other facilities. The golf stand didn't open till 9. Ok, one \"resort fee\" not put to good use. At least the pool we swam in was well heated. \n\nThe room was disgusting, including countless hairs belonging to past visitors (owners, perhaps??) on the sheets, blankets and tub. The towels were threadbare and had rust stains that looked like streaks from somebody's butt (nice), and the shower had a crusty dried booger on the wall. We were in the \"deluxe 1 BR suite\", but I can't imagine it was any different than the cheaper studio. Scammed again. \n\nI would rather spend a night in my car than stay here again, and I would no sooner buy than repeatedly poke myself in the eye.

Every prescription he did for me was wrong, and every prescription was wrong because he did not test properly in the first place.   He rushed through the exam  - failed to ask about dilation,  failed to use a reading card etc - and shuttled  me in and out of the exam room at 2 min increments  (he was also \"examining\" several other patients during the same 15 min stint.).\n\nOn top of that, he engaged in aggressive sales practices - my understanding was the doctor was supposed to have no interest or financial stake in the sales of glasses\/lenses.  But here, in front of me, he set the price of a very $$$$ glasses I did not need  - luckliy I was wary by that point and did not make the purchase.  He also spent more time explaining different payment options than he'd spent  actually  examining my eyes. \n\nThe  prescription he gave me was a disaster - it made me naseous and dizzy .  I had to go back and have the part-time doctor make things right - which she did. But none of these problems should have happened in the first place.  \n\nAnd there  was a run-around about whether I would be \"allowed\" to get a refund for  the pair of glasses I did get there -- based on the faulty prescription the doctor there had provided!!!  (They were also unable to locate one of my prescriptions, because it was never written up. Looks like the  doctor had, literally, phoned it in.)  I had to get very pushy to get basic good business  practice, and simple fairness, out of this shop.   I never dreamed getting an eye exam would lead to a situation so tense and adversarial, but there you are. \n\nYou go to these places in good faith - expecting a competent eye exam by a competent practioner.   In my experience, the main doctor here operates in bad faith -- and is backed by a sales team that is aggressive and incompetent too.","date":"2009-03-02 14:58:46"}

Had several issues with the food. Two of us ordered the molcajete and lucky us, we had our food sitting in front of us for 10 minutes while we waited for the rest of the family's food to be brought out. The molcajetes were both missing the \"zesty avocado salsa\". The flank steak was very tough and the molcajete (yes, it's literally served in a molcajete) is about 8\" high and bowl-shaped. It was challenging to cut through the meat, what with the butter knives we had. \n\nThree of our party ordered fajitas, and, again they were missing the guac and also the salsa they were supposed to come with. They were also just round iron skillets with onions, peppers and the meat. I'm not sure if they're trying to make a minimalist statement by withholding beans, rice, cheese, pico de gallo, etc, but what the hay? Fajitas are kind of a diy meal. You get a bunch of stuff and you mix it up the way you like, right?\n\nOne of the fajita-orderers asked for salsa and it was crazy hot. I realize that heat is a subjective thing. Suffice it to say that my tongue can take some heat but this was habanero'ed. I could eat it but it was painful. I'm not saying I didn't eat it. I did. I can't NOT eat salsa if it's in front of my face. But I would have preferred more flavor, less heat.\n\nIn a nutshell:  The service was great. The food was palatable. The timing was horrible. And missing elements of dishes is kind of lame. \n\nWon't be going back.","date":"2013-05-28 20:46:22"}

My friends who still live in ATL discovered the restaurant and go all the time, so we came here with a group of 12 girls on the Friday night of my bachelorette party weekend for dinner and drinks.  I literally couldn't think of a more fun restaurant atmosphere and am so grateful for this place!\n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy, and looks like your standard authentic Italian restaurant.... if that restaurant was drunk (and I mean that in the best way!)  Everything glows red because of the rope lights everywhere, and there is SO MUCH TO LOOK AT!  Framed pictures and posters and signs and paper lanterns and chairs hanging from the ceiling....  And there are racks of hats throughout the restaurant that you can not only borrow to wear during dinner, but are seemingly encouraged to!  Everyone in my party borrowed a fun hat - mine was a sequined cowboy hat with a rhinestone tiara on top!  They play their music pretty loudly, and it's upbeat and fun.  The disco ball will randomly start spinning and when you least expect it the fog machine will go off.  And in the back room where we were sitting all of this organized chaos was offset by a large TV screen showing scenic and peaceful views of Italy.  \n\nThe food itself was average at best.  I started with the fried calamari appetizer and it was okay, but tasted a bit under seasoned.  For my entr√©e I got the \"classical rendition\" fettuccini alfredo, which was also just fair.  The noodles tasted homemade, but the sauce was also under seasoned and very oily.  Also, this place isn't necessarily cheap for the food they're serving - the fettuccini was $22.95.  But I think you honestly pay for the atmosphere and good vibes there, and that's why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 2 or 3.  That food for that price would have been disappointing if I wasn't having such a blast in such a fun place with my friends!\n\nThe restaurant also gave us all complimentary limoncello shots in honor of my bachelorette weekend, which was delicious and so very nice of them!  The bottle of limoncello was frozen in a bucket with a bunch of lemons, which makes for a pretty neat presentation (though it probably doesn't make it the easiest to pour).  Basically, this was the perfect spot for this weekend and we all really enjoyed ourselves.  They welcomed us with open arms and made sure we had fun!  Sure the food isn't the best ever, but really Atlanta isn't even known for having amazing Italian food so this should be no shock.  Come here when you want a place where the food is second to the atmosphere, and consider Il Localino for a fun birthday or bachelorette party dinner!","date":"2015-07-28 13:15:04"}

If the regular 9 dollar deal is say 10 wings, then if you get 5 for 6 bucks at happy hour, all they are doing is shorting you the wings!

I hustled my 3-year-old into the car one morning and told him I had a surprise for him. I needed a partner in crime on this particular excursion. \n\nOH.\n\nMY.\n\nGOD.\n\nSeriously! This stuff is AMAZING! I mean, it's not just good by vegan standards--it's GOOD, period. Honestly, I had a fleeting thought while I was there that perhaps they lie and really do use eggs and milk.

It was Tuesday 7\/28 morning and they said there is not enough room to fit 3 tables together. \nThere was 3 tables around us that were empty when we sat down. There was room to put 3 tables together, but instead he thought it was smarter to put 2 tables together for  6 of us and another 2tables together for only 4 people.

They were acting like trendy snobby hipsters, I feel they would of being more accommodating at an ihop. I regret my decision of not going to kerbey lane instead. \n\nPlus the kitchen must of set a plastic container on and the entire restaurant was filled with the burn plastic smell.

If these sound a little too adventurous for your taste, you can tone it down with some Lobster Taco's, Shrimp & Grits, Steak Frites (truffle fries are to die for), or a simple yet delicious ravioli dish. While their beer selection is top tier, I would recommend trying one of their featured mixed drinks. \n\nTRP's servers are knowledgeable and well versed with the menu and drink selections. Many will recommend pairings of beers or wines with certain selections. The decor is sleek and elegant, yet unpretentious and modern. As you walk in, you typically notice the packed bar and smiling hostess, but if you look up you'll see large framed pictures on the ceiling portraying neighborhood cookouts.\n\nAs for lunch, there is an assortment of different sandwiches and salads, which are good, but your opinion of the restaurant should not be contingent on a lunch experience. \n\nGo to The Ravenous Pig with a group of close friends, because the experience is too good not to be shared.","date":"2010-01-08 00:03:57"}

We were impressed with the  modern looking building made of cinder blocks, glass and steel blending with the warm and inviting decor due made possible by gentle lighting, beautiful wood tables and warm red seating.  The oversized door welcomed us just as warmly as the manager at the front desk.  I must say I was very distracted (in a good way) by the open kitchen right as we came in.  I'm a huge fan of open kitchens because I think that people working in good restaurants are very talented, and I love to see how clean everything is and how hard they are working to give us a wonderful meal.\n\nAfter being promptly seated our waiter came by and introduced himself and asked for our drink order.  I made the innocuous comment that it was our first trip to Roaring Fork, and did he have anything that were house specialties.  His already pleasant demeanor peaked up a bit, and he made several suggestions for drink, appetizer, and entree.  We were given the perfect amount of time to peruse the menu, and I ended up ordering a Grey Goose Pear\/Amaretto martini, an off-menu NY strip, and the green chili mac & cheese (I'll let my wife, another yelper, tell you what she had).  We asked to split a fried avocado appetizer.\n\nA few minutes later the sous chef showed up with two \"tasting\" for us to try since it was our first trip.  I was deep into my first drink (fantastic!), and didn't quite catch what everything was.  It was a piece of seared Ahi Tuna (my first), a poblano rice (?), and a tomato sauce of some type ... doh!  I wish I paid attention!  I tried to look on the menu when I got home, but it isn't on the menu.  Well, it was wonderful.  When the fried avocado showed up they were perfect, too.  A warm avocado with a thin crispy coating served with a bit of spicy crab remoulade.\n\nDinner comes, and they ask me to cut into the side of beef masquerading as a NY Strip.  They flashed some light on the middle, and it was underdone.  They whisked it away with an apology.  The waiter came over with an apology.  The manager brought my steak back with an apology.  I was starting to feel bad that they cooked my steak to rare instead of medium like I asked!  \"No, no... it's okay.  It's fine.  Thankyouverymuch\" (I'm almost done with the second martini at this point...)  The strip was wonderful since they treated the steak the way you are supposed to treat any good steak.  A little salt, a little pepper, some wood-fired heat, and enjoy.  And boy did I enjoy.  The green chili mac was fantastic, too.\n\nAnd with all of that I wish I had ordered what my wife got!  (but, that's her review to give, not mine.  Check out \"Deanna B.\")\n\nThey comp'd a dessert for us, and although pleasantly full we couldn't refuse.  We tried the cornbread pineapple upside down cake.  (I'd seen too many photos of it on Yelp not to try it.)  Warm moist and sweet cornbread with pineapple rings and a scoop of Amy's vanilla ice cream.  I LOVED that it wasn't an overly sweet mess.  That was my kind of dessert!\n\nI wish I could live the life that offered the ability to have this quality meal every day (but not necessarily this QUANTITY!)  I said it several times, and I'm going to say it here, I have a new favorite restaurant - the Roaring Fork.","date":"2011-03-20 08:56:33"}

The restaurant  has three dinning rooms and is very spacious so we didn't have wait long for our table. During the short walk to our table we got a brief description of the room we would be dining in. We dined in the Grand Gallery which was very decorative with beautifully designed lantern animals on the wall that followed an animal\/planet conservation theme.\n\nWe were then greeted by our server who gave us a rundown of the menu. I had made sure to mention to her that it was our second time dinning at Tiffins, just in case there were any changes made from our previous visit. (We liked it that much we had to come for a second visit). She informed us that there had been a few changes to the menu such as replacing the Duo of Lamb with the Duo of Venison and switching out the Grouper for a Swordfish.\n\nAfter thinking long and hard about the menu, we finally decided on two entrees: The Pomegranate -lacquered chicken and the Seared Hokkaido Scallops.  As we waited for the food to come out, the server brought out some complimentary bread for us to snack on. It was Pomegranate Focaccia bread, and let me tell you, it was very unique and delicious. It was not too fluffy, but a slightly more dense type of bread. It also was also lightly glazed with a molasses sauce which gave it just the right amount of sweetness. In addition to that, there was a dipping sauce made of molasses, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and hints of pomegranate which gave it the right amount of tanginess. The server had told us to use it sparingly because a little went a long way. But It was so delicious! We even got seconds on the bread.\n\nMy entr√©e was equally as delicious.  The food was plated beautifully and the taste was on point.  The chicken was nicely flavored and moist. It pretty much fell off the bone and went great with the Sweet Potato Pap. The Thumbelina carrots were also super cute and yummy.  The Fennel salad was a great compliment to all the flavors and textures of the dish.  I tried a piece of the scallops and they were so good! We also ordered a side of Brussel sprouts which came in a pretty decently sized considering it was a side.  There were bits of bacon pieces in the Brussels which made it even better!\n\nOverall, an excellent dinner filled with great food, great service and a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. The prices are a little on the higher end, but all very worth it. Located right outside of the new Pandora attraction. It's perfect if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Animal Kingdom.","date":"2017-06-06 20:05:05"}

There's a HUGE East African population (e.g., Somalis, Eritreans, etc. etc.)  They demand good Ethiopian food--and they get it.  \n\nI know that a lot of Yelpers travel a good bit.  You may find yourself in DC sometime soon.  Save your  Ethiopian adventure for when you're in our nation's capital.  (Make sure to visit \"the U St. corrider\" the neighborhood U between 12th and 9th.)\n\nIf you get Ethiopian food in DC, you're in for a treat.\n\nIf you get Ethiopian food at Asmara, you're destined for disappointment.","date":"2009-10-14 13:14:49"}

It's really, really good fried chicken.\n\nDan Dan fries are also a creative new take on loaded up fries that tastes very good and is very filling. Bottled soda with real sugar is a nice touch.

I switched to pulled pork, because I knew it only needed to be plated from a steam table. I wanted to eat with my wife, not watch her while they cooked something else.

How serious am I? I made an account just to write this review, so.....\n\nI went to Chedds last night on a whim because it sounded like a novel concept: grilled cheese. How can you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich? Imagine all the cheeses they can squish between bread! Delightful.\n\nWe walked in and it was apparent that this was not the type of place I needed to be. There were all these crayon-scribbled pictures of cheese from kids lining the counter, so automatically I'm like, oh, this is one of THOSE places. Aesthetic judgment aside, I went for a BCT -- bacon, tomato, spinach, mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat. Simple enough. I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain. This is where the real trouble begins. \n\nAs I was getting my tea, I noticed the strange, vague smell of bad eggs. I thought this was due to the fountain station's proximity to the trash can. I was incorrect. I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul. I couldn't quite place the actual flavor, but something was clearly not okay about this tea. I opened the lid to smell it (because of course I did), and it smelled like rotten eggs, sort of like sulfur. How does this even happen to iced tea? I had my companion smell the tea, and he agreed that it smelled awful. \n\nI went to the counter to point out this atrocity to the greasy-haired slacker employee. I told him he should smell my drink. He said, \"No, I'm good. I'll check on it, though.\" He gave me a new cup. I hesitantly got myself a Dr. Pepper. In all fairness, he did change out the iced tea immediately, but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order. Look, I'd be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop, too, but this was unacceptable.\n\nThe sandwiches themselves are not actual grilled cheese sandwiches. They're more like panini sandwiches, made in a big flat press. They're greasy, the bread doesn't adhere to the cheese, and they're mediocre in flavor at best. You could make a better sandwich at home for much less.","date":"2012-04-28 21:29:14"}

Scratching my head in that decision. Carne Asada Fajitas were great but flour tortillas in enchiladas are like 'Rubber' very disappointing and it was the same comment from two different people other than myself! \n\nWell after reading some of the negatives it reminded me that bad news travels fast and good news travels slow. If you're reading this you should remember to read between the lines and differentiate if you can, who's being accurate and who is not worth listening to. \n\nThe other reviews made me realize that there are a lot of people who live around here that have no concept of attending an adult restaurant. I always scratched my head why some parents bring children to restaurants that are clearly for adults when they SHOULD be taking their children to Denny's or some other 'family' restaurant! The last thing people want to do is to go to a very nice place and listen to annoying children being loud!!!! Or worse, a baby crying! \n\nThe fact is this is an obvious restaurant geared for adults. Our kind of place. The first compliment I want to give is to the ambience.  It is fantastic--from the decor to the very large windows that open to the street on both sides of the building. The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Prices were inexpensive, I think they should raise their prices! This would help keep a more high end clientele. In viewing the menu I knew the food was going to be good just based on their flavorings and descriptions. 95% of all Mexican restaurants make generic Mexican food! Yes, that food is good as well but, once in awhile you will come across a rare find. The only other upscale Mexican restaurant I have found is Javier's in Newport Beach, CA. \nAt Matador, the food was good. I like how you can choose a traditional dish but then they have variety of flavors and spices from which to choose for the preparation. The Queso was just ok, it's more of a bean dip with some cheese. They need to reverse it and have less bean dip and a lot more queso. With the Street Tacos they should allow you to pick what meat you want inside. Here they give you 5 tacos, each with a different meat and flavor. We found we preferred 2 of the 5. Chips and salsa were good. Salsa could be a bit more spicy. But the way they make it will allow more people to enjoy it. I would recommend having 2 salsas and let the customer get what they want. I like spicy, my wife doesn't.  The best plate I had was the Spicy Mexican Shrimp with habanero sauce and a Jalape√±o Corn Bread. This plate was amazing! At the end of the day I told my wife, \"Why would we go to any other Mexican place when we can come here for the ambience?\" Most people take pics of the food. To me it's all about the atmosphere. \n\nWe just moved to The Pearl and have not been to another Mexican restaurant in Portland prior to The Matador. No need for us to look any further!\n\nWe'd like to thank Corah our server. We enjoyed her company, very friendly and knowledgable.","date":"2016-05-31 04:40:21"}

At first, I thought the dish was going to be too sweet... but after a bite or two, ah!  what a perfect blend of flavors!  So very good!  It's opulently rich and delicious.

To top it off, she followed up with an email checking to see if I'd made a decision and when I resurfaced months later to order the rehearsal dress, she immediately responded and helped me wrap things up. \n\nBHLDN is definitely worth the trip if you love their aesthetic and\/or price point and I definitely recommend requesting Whitney if she's available!","date":"2016-07-14 19:22:35"}

We have been customers of this location for nearly seven years.  SEVEN YEARS. THREE CARS. We were there when Gordon was the manger and now Fitz. For the most part, we've been happy,  loyal faithful customers.  But today, oh, today when I promised to take my daughter on a special outing in Natick, the car wouldn't accelerate and the engine began knocking right as we pulled into the parking lot of the Natick mall. I had to take my car to a Sears auto repair shop to confirm that yes, my motor does not have any oil, and yes, the knocking and lack of acceleration was due to the lack of oil, and oh yes there is serious damage to my engine.  Damage that WAS NOT there prior to taking my car into the Monro. Our car has only 81341 miles on it--damage of this magnitude is ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous.  As a loyal customer I expect  my car to be repaired in a timely manner, completely and without additional cost to us.  I will say this, that after several phone calls this evening to the shop close to the end business, Rick, the manager on duty, finally got a hold of Fitz on his cell phone and Fitz authorized payment of a tow truck from Natick to Watertown to get our car back the the shop. This good faith gesture communicates culpability and interest in making us whole. Therefore, I have faith that they will make this right.

I had heard so many good things about it...yet i was a bit disappointed. The service was good and the style was cool...but I thought the food was not worth the moola. I had...I think it was called...Captain's Chicken (or something like that). It was described as a curry chicken on a bed of jasmine rice with golden raisins and mango chutney etc. etc. Sounded amazing to me! Sadly...the rice was undercooked...the sauce a little watery and while the chicken was cooked well...the flavor wasn't as spectacular as I had expected. But then again maybe I just didn't pick the right thing. \nMy brother-in-law and mother-in-law had prime rib...which was as far as I could tell from their zealous consumption of it that is was wonderful. My father-in-law had rack of lamb which he also seemed happy about. Oh...and they were crazy about the hush puppies...they were good...but to me...pretty forgettable. \nI'll definitely give it another try, but so far...not in my top five.","date":"2009-08-04 04:31:32"}

It was another couple minutes before I was seated. Person who sat me then apologized about the wait. \n\nGrotto is small and in a basement of sorts. It's dark and pretty cramped. \nI also waited considerably for my order to be taken. My server was Angela. I finally ordered the calamari to start. It was fantastic!I had the potato gnocchi with mushrooms and I was really excited and hoped it would be amazing. It was good, but room temp when it arrived at my table.

Yummy.\r\n\r\nThe only complaint I had about the experience was our server's lack of training.  He was chatty and well meaning, but couldn't answer much about the wine list or menu.  We went when Lobby was fairly new, though, so I think this will resolve itself.","date":"2006-04-20 17:45:34"}

I had fried chicken and while it looked small it was all meat. It was a little under-seasoned for my taste, but still pretty good. We also got an order of fried green tomatoes. Not the best I've ever had but tasty enough. They have a great selection of sides. I had mashed potatoes and mac & cheese, no complaints. We left full and satisfied. \n\nI probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars but I hate the whole cafeteria-style set-up. The Coop is run by the same people that did 4Rivers and it's the same concept: you stand in line, order your food, pay, and then carry everything to whatever table is available.  We waited in line about 30 minutes at 2pm on a Friday. I can't imagine what it's like at noon. My husband has a disability that makes it hard for him to stand, so that was inconvenient. In addition, I then had carry two trays of food across the restaurant and through the back doors to the patio because that's where there were open tables (first world problems, I know). The weather was great, so the eating experience was nice, it was just everything up to that point that that was annoying.

Which is strange that it is only the section of the ceiling  located right at the entrance. The other sections of the ceiling are fine.\n\nSecondly, $1 grilled cheese Mondays - overrated. While I raved before, having gone back and had and\/or attempted to enjoy the special, it's nothing to waste your time for. The grilled cheese has become bready and bland. Yes, it's only a dollar and you get chips, but I'd rather just make my own bomb-ass grilled cheese at home -without the hour (or sometimes two) wait.\n\nThirdly, the noise level. Loud as fuck, any time of the day. Music blasts, people have to scream over each other. Downright annoys me because my friends are constantly saying, \"huh? what?\" And I hate repeating myself.\n\nLastly, the space\/size. TINY. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a \"constant\" flow of patrons, as in they go in, order their bar, and then can chill off to the side or on a patio.

There was already a long line going down the sidewalk and if we had arrived any later, we may had to have waited to get a table. When the restaurant doors opened, Vikram Vij himself, the owner of the restaurant, greeted everyone individually as they walked in. He also would stop by our table a couple times throughout the meal to ask us what we thought of the food.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal occurred even before my table ordered any food. The servers stop by the table with a tray of goodies where one could just grab a piece to eat in a single bite. Each one is flavorful in spices in its own unique way and they really do end up whetting the appetite. One of these things they bring to the table is their chai tea which was particularly excellent.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered a bunch of dishes which included samosas, eggplant curry, mutton kebab, and much more. What I loved about each of their curry dishes is that the sauces are different for each one and are quite distinct from one another. Three of the more memorable dishes for me are their lamb popsicles, portobello mushroom curry, and spicy goat curry. The lamb is super tender and has it's signature gamey taste laid atop a pool of yellow curry which was my favorite sauce amongst all the dishes. The portobello mushroom curry includes a thicker and creamier curry sauce with meaty and hearty mushrooms that were cooked perfectly. The spicy goat curry was great in that.. well... unlike the other sauces, this one had a nice spicy kick to it. I felt that this dish paired well with the mango lassi which is thick and refreshing.","date":"2017-04-07 23:54:19"}

Last summer they served me a seasonally available blueberry iced coffee that was so fresh and lovely I am still craving it. The coffee itself is buttery, with notes of chocolate and fruit. I have a small restaurant. When we inquired with a few roasters around town about serving their coffee we weren't taken seriously and even blown off \/ snubbed. Todd, despite or in addition to having some of the most delicious coffee in town never underestimated us. Now that the restaurant is gaining some notoriety, I can TRULY say, thank you Ole Latte for believing in us and making us part of the family. We are huge fans. 5 stars.

Being that I usually spend around $75 or so on a haircut, I figured this was an area where I can try to cut costs.\n\nI contemplated going to a SuperCuts or HairCuttery, but thanks to fellow Yelpers' horrid reviews, I opted against it. I eventually stumbled upon the glowing reviews for Coco Head Hair Studio in Chinatown. Being that I work a mere few minutes walk away from Chinatown, it was worth a try.\n\nErnie was my stylist. He took a look at my hair (which I hadn't cut in about 5 months--I have a bad habit of doing that), asked questions, communicated his thoughts and vision for what to do and why, and always checked with me first before proceeding with anything. He was very meticulous with his work, and my haircut turned out great!  My hair somehow even looks healthier because of it. I can already tell that it's one of those haircuts that will continue to look great even as it grows out. Definitely worth the $38!","date":"2008-12-04 01:57:09"}

They had two outlets in the store that I could find, neither of which were situated near tables. Why have wi-fi if people can't plug in their laptops?\n\nWhen I ordered my chai, I was encouraged because they asked me if I wanted spicy or sweet. I chose the spicy chai, but what I got tasted like skim milk with vanilla and a dash of nutmeg. Apparently the Stumptown they serve didn't taste great either.\n\nBut my biggest complaint was the little care they took to make customers comfortable. I counted three fans in the store, all pointed to the counter and prep areas, rather than out to the customers. To make up for this, I guess, they had the front door wide open.

He also noted that the recall did indeed apply to my car and they'd need it back for 36+ hours during a weekday at some point soon.  \n\nWhile my review relates to the service department alone, I've loved my Tiburon since the day I got it and aside from one set of tires I'd never had to pay for a repair up until last Friday - I'd gladly buy from them again.","date":"2010-08-20 22:18:56"}

This complaint is for their customer service.  I ordered online delivery of a cake, but then tried to immediately  cancel the order once I saw that shipping (within Cambridge, to an address only several blocks away!) was 43 dollars.  I tried to call to cancel, but they were closed, and I filled out the online customer service request immediately to cancel.  They never cancelled my order.  However, they still charged me for the cake and the delivery, which was a day LATE anyway.  I called today to get some of the delivery fees refunded, and the employee told me they \"did get my email message, but it was too late to cancel the order.\"  Why did they not contact me?  I don't know.  The employee then told me I would have to call the store directly to get a refund for delivery fees.  She said she would call them for me, and that I would get a call back right away.  Nobody called me back.  What horrible customer service.\n\nUPDATE (5\/23):\nI forgot to mention that when the cake was going to be delivered, I got a call from an unidentified person saying I was going to receive a packaged surprise that morning.  Since it was Mother's Day I was all excited, thinking I was going to get a gift.  But no, it was Rosie's Bakery calling me, the buyer, rather than the recipent, to notify of an upcoming delivery.  So that really sucked, staying home, waiting for a  Mother's Day present that never came.  Bummer.  But today I actually managed to get someone on the phone who would refund the delivery fees to me, since the cake did get delivered to my recipent, even though it was woefully late.  But it did take three days of calling Rosie's to accomplish this feat.  So this review remains a ONE STAR.","date":"2007-05-17 19:46:29"}

I bought: Marble Coffee Cake, Madeleine, 2 Macaroons (Mocha and Green Tea), and Red Bean Pastry. The Macaroons were okay. My friends have raved about it with pictures I have seen on Instagram and statuses on Facebook. Nothing special. I thought macaroons were suppose to be softer, not crunchy on the exterior.

During SXSW we went to see a band and guys checking IDs checked my purse and I had a half bottle of water in it., you know, so I could stay hydrated while walking around. They told me I couldn't bring it in, which was fine, so I told them I would just down it. One of the guys had a completely pissed off look on his face and told me I needed to dump it as I was drinking it and kept talking at me, to dump it, like he had control of the sidewalk. That we needed to \"expedite\" things. There was literally nobody behind us. They were acting all frantic and hurried.  Then the wristband checker spoke rudely because I didn't stop to show her the yellow part, which I didn't know she had to see being the first SX venue I attended and the other door staff already saw my wristband. I attended a couple of other venues that night, thinking that these other places would also act like that because of the festival. I was wrong. They were all MUCH friendlier and now I would rather avoid this place, if other venues have comparable bands. They should really be a little more friendly to their paying customers.","date":"2015-03-18 19:27:03"}

Friends recommended the Thai Cuisine version so off we went.\n\nFirst of all the entranceway where you had to wait to be seated was a mess. People stacked up and the host came but he was so involved with a lady with a missing online order that he ignored all the people stacking up. After about 5 plus minutes of waiting another gentleman came out from the back apologized and immediately took charge and seated everyone.¬†\n\nFood that was ordered Pad Thai,¬†Kao Man Kai (steamed¬†chicken version not the fried), a Thai Tea and water. The Thai tea that came was awesome. It was a very tall glass, very surprised and impressed. The Pad Thai that came was tasty but the noodles were a bit over cooked but not too badly done. I do recommend this dish if you come looking for it.¬†\n\nThe¬†Kao Man Kai is a whole other story, so much I had to devote nearly my whole review on it. It came and it looked dry, like drink my whole huge Thai Tea and another glass of water dry. It's supposed to be the Thai version of¬†Hainanese chicken. It's supposed to be tender and juicy with nicely steamed rice made with the chicken broth\/fat. It's was the complete opposite. First of all it was all white meat, dry skinless breast meat overcooked. Second tasteless, sigh. ¬†Did I mention skinless? You are supposed to leave the skin on, not necessarily to eat, it's so when you cook\/steam it that it does not dry up so horribly. The rice I was hoping had redeeming features, it didn't. It was steamed then looked like tossed with what looked like little fried onion bits. What it ended up being like was steamed soft rice with bits of what felt like uncooked rice (the fried onions that softened a bit in the steamed rice). Highly do not recommend.¬†\n\nOverall not too bad if you didn't want the chicken. ¬†I wanted to try the purple rice dessert as that is my favorite Thai dessert but after eating the mess of the chicken we wanted our bill and to get out of there. The bill all total was under¬†$30¬†so not too expensive but next time stick with the noodles dishes.","date":"2017-09-09 03:03:47"}

So, I will err on the side of more rather than less.\n\nThat being said, we were there with a group of 8 on a Saturday night. Great set-up and sweet to be accommodated. Allow me to set the mood: the night was hot. It was a scorcher. The room large with beautiful dividers made of wood and bubbly glass. Lighting was romantic. Garage doors that open into the night air... but those doors being open on night like this last Saturday was not too terribly enjoyable. In one word: SWEEEAAATTTYY. The wood chairs do not help that situation one bit.\n\nThe wine selection was pretty good - not too much in the way of entry-level choices though. There are SO many good cheap wines out there that I'd like to see at least a couple available. Okay, granted, I am going to drop a good $50 on dinner... so I guess that it just comes with the entire package - but I'd still like to have a good wine to drink while I'm waiting that doesn't cost a million dollars.\n\nThe food was great. I had the beat salad and the halibut. The beet salad was awesome because it had goat cheese on it... and quite frankly you can top a pile of crap with goat cheese and I'll probably like it. The best part about that is that the goat cheese was PILED on there. Yeah, baby... just the way I like it. The halibut was cooked to perfection. Moist and the flavors were fresh and clean. Really a great dish for keeping it light so that I could finish it off with the dark chocolate mousse. Did you say dark chocolate mousse? Oh, yes I did... and it is GOOD.\n\nThe waiter was VERY average, and that is, in my opinion, a HUGE downer in a place like this. I mean, I'm dropping some serious cash on dinner - please send me a waiter that has got his shit together. He was knowledgeable about the wine\/beer\/food, but didn't get me a refill on the coffee when he gave everyone else one. Also when we showed up (after everyone else already had a drink), he didn't come over to find out if we wanted a drink. Um, yo - what are you doing, dude?\n\nThey switch up the menu often, and they also do a Prix Fixe menu for $56. Seems like that'd be the way to go if your group were up for it.

Union Square is becoming a locavore hub, and it's great to see another business hop on the wagon. They also removed all trash cans, using all recyclable & compostable products for take-out cups and napkins.\n\nThe noise levels can vary from normal conversation to very quiet, depending upon where you sit, but except for the busiest of days, there's rarely a wait to find a place to settle down.

While on vacation in Orlando I took to yelp to find us a good dinner after being sick of eating theme park food for three days! When I saw border grill I was sold. Hole in the wall local places are my favorite! Especially considering I work in one so that might make me a little biased:) \nWhen we got there it was packed and it made me so ready to eat some good food! All the reviews I read said you order at the counter so we walked up and stood there for a while while the girls were busy behind the counter filling drinks and using the register. We patiently waited but no one looked up.. Maybe they were too involved in their work, I don't know. Eventually a girl walked by and said have a seat anywhere you'd like. Okay, so we sit outside at one of the only available tables in the place. I made eye contact with our waitress (the one who told us to sit anywhere so she knew we were wanting to eat there) at least 3 times and still she never came out for AT LEAST 5 minutes. Being a waitress this is unacceptable leaving a table sitting not greeted that long. We listened to the table behind us complaining about the time they had been waiting for their food. Finally they wave her outside and she talks to them, apologizes for the wait and gets their food out promptly. We then think... Okay this is it she's going to acknowledge us. Nope she just walked by again. Finally when she brings them some drink refills she walks by and says are you wanting to order? Um well we need menus we've never been here and she says \"oh you want to dine here?\" \nWho knows maybe sitting outside means you want it togo but I was assuming we could sit anywhere like she said and that was the only place that had open tables. \nAfter we got menus and drinks everything went smooth from there- \nWe used yelps check in deal to get free chips, salsa and queso! Added bonus- we got a little guacamole too! My husband is a huge queso fan so he devoured that. I was partial to the guacamole so we were both happy with that. we both ordered the Chicago burrito recommended from fellow yelpers and they did not disappoint! I ordered mine with shredded chicken and my husband ordered the al pastor(pork) we were in HEAVEN!!! They also have a caddy of different hot sauces that we poured all over our burritos! Super good. The hottest one is the bright green and it wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it it was very good! Try it you won't be sorry! After the other tables left our server was way more attentive so maybe she was just overwhelmed and the food was so good we left very happy. I wish I could pick up this place and bring it home with me. The food was THAT good. Try it, just maybe sit inside so you get service a little faster.","date":"2015-01-03 20:49:02"}

I think they recently opened as there were still many bouquet signs in front when I visited with my family.  \n\nThe menu seems to have a wide variety of foods from the simple rice and noodle dishes to the more elaborate like braise lamb hot pot.  The ambience seem nice with the tasteful decor, with good comfortable seating that is not too crowded.  \n\nBut that's where the good side ends.  Our server seemed very rushed to take our order after we sat down (at 11am just when they opened).  She came to our table 3 times in a short span of 5 minutes.  We did not realize why until we placed our order for a couple of appetizer dishes (Hand shredded chicken and 7-flavor deep fried squid) and a couple of entree dishes (Fried noodles with chicken, Mapo tofu rice, Sauteed shrimp).  It took almost 35 minutes until our first dish showed up which seem an eternity when one is hungry for brunch.  \n\nWhen the food dishes showed up at last, we were very disappointed at every dish.  The hand shredded chicken was more of cut-up pieces of chicken with little taste and too many pieces of skin thrown in.  The 7-flavour deep-fried squid tasted bland -- I tasted salty which is just one flavour as I tried to find more flavour.  The fried noodles looked good but lacked anything special (including taste!).  The sauteed shrimps were not well de-veined so tasted bitter.  We all thought what could possibly go wrong with mapo tofu rice?  Well, the mapo sauce was definitely from a jar so that was pretty hard to mess up, but the rice was too hard (tasted like rice left in a refrigerator overnight).  Very disappointed at the food at Lucky Plus!  \n\nTo add to the poor service and bad quality food, we were presented with the same dishes we had already eaten 3 times over!  If the food quality was better we might have taken up their offer!  But we were honestly not interested in more of the same bad dishes.  \n\nWe hope that Lucky Plus is just testing their kitchen process to make improvements and honing their waiting service to provide a more enjoyable experience for their customers.  But they will need to do this quickly as many traditional Chinese clients like myself would not likely go back after the one bad experience.","date":"2015-12-20 22:30:59"}

I once had lunch here three weekdays in a row. (And I'm not ashamed to admit that that was just last week.)\n\nDua is admittedly not the most \"ethnic\" restaurant out there -- you won't find an expansive menu with all sorts of obscure Vietnamese eats. But then again, this is downtown Atlanta, not Buford Highway. What you will find is a simple menu that appeals to most, if not all, palates, offering up many varieties of pho (a noodle soup), bun (a cold noodle dish), com (a rice dish), mi xao (a stir fried noodle dish), and salad.\n\nI've had the opportunity to try quite a few of the dishes here, and they're all quite good:\n- #1 Beef Pho (regular $6.25, large $6.95): A good-sized portion, though not the largest I've seen. The flavor tends to be consistently spot on. Garnishes, however, are limited to a small plate of sprouts and basil leaves.\n- C3 Grilled Shredded Pork & Eggs ($6.95): One of my favorite dishes here. The pork is juicy, tender, and flavorful. But it's the runny fried egg on top that brings everything together. Note that this dish ought to be pretty inoffensive, even to those completely unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine.\n- B1 Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($6.95): I can't get enough of the grilled pork here. Here, it's served over cold vermicelli, very lightly dressed with, among other things, fish sauce (I think). Served with a crispy, chopped egg roll.\n- M1 Pork Mi Xao ($6.95): Stir fried noodles. Given the nature of this dish, it's a bit blander and a bit less satisfying than the rest, but it's still quite good.\n\nWhile Dua, like most casual downtown eateries, is only open for lunch, it gets absolutely slammed at that hour. The result is that their operation has grown to become pretty efficient -- stand in line against the wall, on which multiple copies of the menu are plastered; order at one of the two registers, where you pay and pick up a number; get your drink, silverware, and napkins; find a seat on the main level, outside, or downstairs; and wait for your food to be delivered. All very business. Note that most of the tables are designed for one or two diners, so  you might have to go outside, go downstairs, or move around some furniture for larger parties.\n\nI'll definitely be back -- maybe next week, I'll try for four.","date":"2011-06-29 04:00:11"}

We stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The place was not crowded even by 9am, but the meal was excellent. Walk up counter service and a good eating space. The menu includes several specialty crepes and also offers a custom \"build your own\" option. I opted for the \"Sunday Morning\" breakfast Crepe; including bacon, ham, egg, spinach, mushroom, tomato, & a Cajun remoulade (which was not really spicy at all). They make the crepes on the spot and then fill it with the requested ingredients. My wife ordered the  \"Sweet Tooth\" crepe (which I tried a bite!). The Sweet Tooth included strawberries, bananas, Nutella, & peanut butter. Great sweet breakfast treat.

And again.  And... you get the picture.  Over the years I've donated my hair twice, and I have never had a more fantastic grow out from a dramatic cut than from the stylists at 22 Changes.\n\nThese days I see Cynthia, and she is AMAZING.  She's been cutting my husband and my hair for the past two years, and we always look and feel great after we leave.  Personally, I like to talk to my stylist while getting my hair cut, and if you also do, you will have a really fun time talking with Cynthia.  She really cares about what I want, and she puts me at ease so I don't feel awkward if I want her to change or add something.\n\nThey are a bit expensive for a cut, but it is absolutely worth every penny.  Cynthia gives me haircuts that are so manageable I can wash my hair, let it air dry on the way to work, and it still looks fantastic all day.\n\nGive this place a try, and definitely give Cynthia a try.","date":"2013-01-27 20:32:19"}

After assuring me of their authenticity, I needed to have my wedding band sized and engraved.  She measured my ring size and took down what I wanted engraved.  She quoted me a price to perform these services and gave me a receipt for pick up.\n\nThroughout the process, Amie B. was professional, available, and seemed genuinely interested in my satisfaction with the result.  I cannot speak regarding the experiences that others may have had with a single point of contact, but my experience has been wonderful and I appreciated the personal nature of the transaction.\n\nI suppose that the overall satisfaction that I felt with my entire experience at Cartier was that after quoting me a price for sizing and engraving my wedding band, they did not require payment for either when I went to pick it up.

The planning and execution of this cemetery is stunningly poetic and heart breakingly beautiful. Walking through the grounds, it's easy to feel entranced by the eerie calmness located in the middle of such a fast paced, dog eat dog metropolis. \n\nEdward Gorey's Mystery trailer must have been based off of Mount Auburn Cemetery, using its elegant and occasionally whimsical memorials for the perfectly creepy introduction. The antiquated names on the headstones find their way into my \"name vault\" for future children: Lavinia, Dahlia, Mercy, Silence, Hiram, Levi, Amos, Wesley, Ira (Okay, Ira was a joke - that's not really a name I'd choose, but it makes me smile - serenely, of course). The urn sculptures and the detailed ironwork have an ethereal creepiness matched only by the New Orleans cemeteries I've toured, but in the Mount Auburn Cemetery, the light through the trees makes each resting ground look somehow welcoming, like a reward rather than a VERY permanent address. The trees twist and turn their manicured limbs every which way, with their naked branches creating a collective hushed \"oooooOOOooooooOOOO\" sound from the cold winter wind. The sound is wonderful. \n\nTaking the uphill route on nearly every road leads you to the tower, with a commanding view of Boston and her neighboring cities. You can hear the muffled sounds of the cities making their way to you, letting you know you're still alive and breathing. Looking down you see the snaky paths leading you around the property, writhing between ponds and tree groves, chapels and elegant sculptures. Spend an afternoon or a whole day reading tombs and contemplating this mortal coil, realizing the most horrible tragedy is that you will never earn enough to secure your own final resting spot in Mount Auburn Cemetery.","date":"2008-12-04 04:23:59"}

Before I booked, I called to ask if there were any amenities that were not offered to guests because they were owner specific, I was told no.  I arrived after a 7 hour drive.  The front desk staff was professional and engaging and the check-in was short.  There were a few rooms to choose from.  I stated that I wanted to be close to the pool.  Went to the room to settle in.  Walked in... ummmm wait a minute.  The room wasn't cleaned.  Walked into the master bedroom to find the bed unmade and the receipts from the last person on the bed and dry cleaner tags.  As a germaphobe, I was completed freaked out.  I walked back to the front because when I called, I was placed on hold.  Staff was apologetic but it pretty much set the mood and what I was to expect moving forward.  A new room was assigned.  It was clean.  However, during my stay we called for extra towels for the pool at 10a.  I looked up and realized an hour had gone by and still no towels.  Called again.  Another hour.  No towels.  Another call... 30 more minutes.  I finally decided to call and ask for a manager because at this point, I am livid.  Within 15 minutes, the towels came.  However, I was perplexed as to why we had to ask 4 times and why it took almost 3 hours.  At this point, I was ready to go home and didn't even want to stay for the last night.

In my dress search, I went to 11(!) different bridal shops across MA and NH looking for a dress $1,800 and under.  I found a dress here that I liked for under $1,000!  They have a larger selection of dresses under $1,000 than any of the other stores that I went to.  It is very much a mom and pop shop, and they are very patient with no sales pressure.  They were also not off put with my price point, unlike some of the other stores that I visited.  I enjoyed being able to browse the dresses instead of just having the sales person chose a few for me to try on.  With that said, the dress I chose was actually one that the salesperson chose for me, and probably would not have been a dress that I chose myself!  They also matched a beautiful veil with it that I purchased as well.  It was very sweet that they gave me a bottle of prosecco when I said yes to the dress!  They also gave my mom a mini bottle so that we could have a toast when we got back to the house.  So far, I am very pleased.

Not once did I feel pressured or stressed out (and with 4 kids of my own, that happens quick!).\n\nWe brought our own cake, but that is all that is allowed-- no outside food, so I couldn't offer snacks to the parents waiting during the laser tag games.  It's a minor thing, but it would've been nice.  The pizza provided was good, but the ice cream was DELICIOUS!  Big servings enough to feed two!  The parents who passed on the cake couldn't resist the ice cream!\n\nMVP was definitely a good choice for 7+ year olds.  The laser tag area is 6000 sq ft with two floors-- it's a series of many, many rooms instead of an 'arena' with obstacles.  The laser tag transforms to a haunted house during this time of year, and the creepy skeleton heads, etc spooked a couple of birthday guests-- either that, or they were just scared of the dark ;)  The 'arcade' mostly has games that give tickets like at Chuck E Cheese-- definitely not the biggest arcade, but it was nice to leave the party room's door open and let the kids run back and forth between the rooms.\n\nWe didn't play mini golf due to the weather, but MVP gave us a pass for future visits as well as discount cards for all of our guests.  The parents were more than eager to take one!\n\nIt's a cozy place so you won't lose your kid, it's clean, and the staff is very energetic and friendly.

But not all allergies are to common allergens, and this is why it's crucial to have ingredient lists on hand and not just in the owner's head.\n\nIf you don't have major food allergies, go ahead and enjoy the passable dumplings.

And the awesome folks at the Kelly Fiat Studio couldn't have made it easier to make my dream come true.\n\nI have to seriously wonder if the salesman I worked with, Dave S., is psychic.  Armed only with the information that I wanted a standard transmission 'pop' 500 model - he led me to the exact car that I had been building obsessively on the Fiat USA website. Creamy white, with a two-tone red & cream interior and a panoramic sunroof. I was doubtful they would even have one in those exact specifications on the lot! \n\nI was comfortable throughout the entire process - from lot, to test drive, to financing, to the moment two days after my initial visit when I returned to pick up my new love.  Every open, responsive person I worked with helped to create a fun, no pressure, no drama environment. The Kelly dealerships motto is \"we make it easy\", and they do. \n\nI'm committed to dealing with Kelly Fiat for at least the next three-years of service for my new car, and I look forward to updating my review as I work with the service staff.

This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. \n\nOur server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.\n\nAfter we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.\n\nAfter waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. \n\nAfter another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.\n\nWithin the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.\n\nShe ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now.

First thing I noticed is pre fixe $35 dinner isn't necessarily a deal. When you add up the individual items they're actually closer to $30! \n\nHad a salad for appetizer which was good- it was just a green salad. For entree I got fried chicken which came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The sides were good but the chicken lacked seasoning. I thought it was kind of bland.

I really like the food here. I always grab a TBM squagel if I'm getting breakfast and for lunch I usually opt for the classic salad which is really filling. The place is in desperate need of a renovation as some of their chair seats are ripping and overall it's a little dirty, they don't maintain it quite so nicely. But really I love the food and they have wifi and there are always tons of places to sit.\n\nFirstly- there are two different staff squads from what I can tell. The weekday morning staff is super on the ball. They are really nice, are great with taking your order and really pay attention to detail when making your salad. They never forget my coffee or orange juice and always bring out the order to me when it's ready even if I'm taking it to go. \n\nBut the weekend morning staff and later in the day staff are pretty awful. They are constantly forgetting my coffee, and when I order multiple squagels to go they somehow get them all mixed up. I really don't understand why the past 4 times I've had to remind them I ordered a coffee. Also, I understand the egg on the squagel doesn't stay put sometimes but the other staff doesn't seem to have a problem making sure the sandwich is stuff, but for whatever reason whenever we get squagels with the weekend morning staff, we get back to the office and everyone is always like- where did the egg disappear to? There are just remnants of egg because they make the sandwich sloppy. Here's the best part, I ordered the basic pizza from them with basil and she tossed parsley on the pizza. We had taken it to go and didn't want to go back. \n\nIt's really hard to figure it out and is quite a toss-up. If you get the right staff you can be super happy with your meal and the wrong staff can just make you sad.","date":"2016-01-04 04:49:36"}

The staff seems a little unsure but extremely friendly nonetheless. The atmosphere is pleasant. It's dimly lit and trendy. We sat in the bar for drinks and appetizers. I will say it is extremely overpriced and agree with some other reviews that it is trying to be what it's not. I find it bothersome that for an $11 martini they use well vodka they don't even use Smirnoff or a lower grade vodka. A \"fancy\" restaurant shouldn't even stock that kind of vodka and knows no one wants it in a martini. The price for a regular martini with an upgrade to a better vodka was $15 and the blue cheese in the blue cheese olives was dried out and seemed to have been stuffed in days before. My boyfriend got a double jack and coke. She asked if he wanted a bigger glass or the single glass. He said single... Which ended up being equivalent to the size of a double shot glass. Smaller than any drinking glass I've ever seen. Both cocktails weren't so hot. \n\nThe food was overpriced for the quality and size of what you get. The escargot was not as good as I would expect it to be. I've had way better at some of the restaurants they are imitating. Spinach dip was pretty good but not worth the price. Overall two small average appetizers and two decent drinks rang us up at nearly $60 before tip. If the prices were lower I would've given a better rating but the value is terrible. An overpriced Applebee's with the facade of an upscale steakhouse.","date":"2014-11-12 11:43:59"}

Oh, and the place is a FROMAGERIE. Fromage = Cheese in French. So yeah, they specialize in cheese.\n\nThough a small joint, yes, you will feel the yuppie Yaletown vibe when you come in. I liked it for what it was.\n\nGuys: Gudrun's a major score if if you take date to this place and she hasn't been - and especially if they (or you) know their favourite cheeses, 'cause I sure as hell didn't and definitely needed some staff recommendations from the owner Patrick.\n\nBut, if you're craving a steak 'n potatoes type meal, dine out somewhere else in Richmond first and then come back here for cheese, wine, and maybe even dessert. And don't complain about how much everything costs.\n\nWhen my boyfriend Leo took me here, I just wanted food. And a non-alcoholic drink. I was eyeing the French Lemonade (the closest thing to juice) but it's $12. And I would have rather spent that money on the cheese, which we did. The staff gave us their latest 3-cheese combo from Canada ($22 with Sfilatino Italian baguette, assorted fruits, nuts, and preserves). I was a bit confused because I thought all the cheese came from Quebec (their monthly offerings are written on the chalkboard wall), but Patrick said two of them were actually from Italy and Spain.\n\nThank Wikipedia for knowing its cheese so I could get this right.\nGarrotxa - The exotic dancer from Spain. My fav on the plate. Rich and didn't need a companion except for a piece of bread to partner her with.\nTallegio - The rare, dark and mysterious character from Italy. Alone, dry, but when combined with the flavours on the plate, a tiger in the bedroom of your mouth.\nIle au grue - The reliable cheddar from Quebec, fine alone, but better with some bread or second flavours.\n\nNow I am a woman who likes a party in my mouth while still feeling substantial. And a party indeed it was. I also ordered the veggie panini with side salad ($12) and since we sat at the bar, we saw the chef prepare everything. Salad - so simple and refreshing, a good cleanser for my palate in between cheese tastings.  The panini, with grilled mushrooms, cucumber, and zucchini, doesn't sound substantial, but all held together with gooey camembert cheese (Where from? Who cares?), it gave me the 5th star for this review.\n\nIf you're intrigued by the - er - intrigue of this place from what everybody else is saying about it, just throw your wallet-watching to the wind and give it a try. Aside from the food and incredible wine list (a rare beer selection too), they have some nice artwork, lighting fixtures and a chalkboard full of stuff you won't be able to pronounce. Tip: Friday special for January '11 is Blue Cheese Sliders.\n\nIf you're the type that wants a stomach-filler and doesn't give a crap about what you taste in your mouth, have your Steveston fish & chips and call it a day.","date":"2011-01-09 01:34:18"}

From the outside, you can see that the facade doesn't look like a typical Chinese restaurant, mainly because this isn't a Chinese take out place... but a classy establishment looking to transport you on a short trip to China. My favorite part about this restaurant is the ambiance. The decor is very intricate and looks like you are sitting in a garden in China, complete with koi ponds around the perimeter. \n\nService here is quite friendly, as our waiter was very nice and attentive. There was also a good drink menu, with many choices and some special tropical\/ Asian inspired cocktails thought up by the bartenders. However, despite the great drinks, and beautiful decor, the food was mediocre. We had crispy tofu which was good, as was the mooshoo pork wraps, however the General T's Chicken wasn't crispy at all. In Ming Court's defense, we strolled up around 9pm and they were tidying up some areas for the night. I think we were one of the last patrons to come in. There is a stage set up, so it looks like there is live music and performances during earlier hours of operation... too bad we missed out on that because we came later in the night. Overall, our experience was okay. I would come more for the service, ambiance, and experience over food. Don't forget to have a few drinks here too- very tasty and at good prices!","date":"2013-05-07 16:40:25"}

Convenient access to the Skytrain; about 10-15 minutes into downtown Vancouver. 10 minute driving distance to a row of restaurants; also has a 24 hour fast food area in the hotel. \n\nOther facilities, besides the Casino and concert area, includes a small workout area overlooking the pool. Workout room has cardio equipment (stair climb machines) and dumbbells up to 30lbs only. Pool area (open till midnight) is fun because of the waterslide. Pool is located near; and provides easy access, to the boardwalk. \n\nThe 2 negative points I have on this place is that \n1) It's not in a complimentary area. I think with a more green area and\/or retail stores surrounding the hotel, it would be more attractive. \n\n2) You are near the airport. The few planes that I heard flying over the hotel was louder than I would have liked outside. In the hotel room (11th floor), I barely heard the planes. So warning to all those light sleepers. If you are a light sleeper, this may not be the best place; unless you try your luck with a lower level floor, which may help reduce the sound even more and completely.

We went on the $5 Pho Wednesday night special. I am so happy we live so close. I know we will be back. The server was so friendly, not just to us but observing his interaction with all the guests I wasn't surprised there were so many people inside. This place on the outside looks so tiny and when you go in, it's huge. We got the small veggie pho and fried tofu pho bowls and they were giant. I saw a woman eating the large and there is no way I could eat that. The small is large enough. Obviously big portions. If you want something vegetarian I recommend the veggie pho not the tofu. It has tons of veggies and if you want tofu, just add it. Wow! Very happy and I look forward to returning. I really hope they keep the time frame of the special till 9pm since I get off work late. Later would be nice too or doing it on other days as well. I have already told friends about this wonderful place. Please go and support this tasty community.","date":"2011-04-22 02:38:36"}

When the owner is there the service especially from the owner is attentive.  I have frequented the tavern quite often and find the bartenders can appear cold and not really engaging,  but they are efficient enough.  \n\nThis last visit I was told we could not sit outside if we were not going to order an entree.  I insisted we would order more than our share of drinks, oysters and salads but was informed that local zoning laws did not allow for seating outside of patrons who did not order an entree.  So that would mean that someone who preferred 2 dozen oysters and a salad would be breaking the law if they sat ouside.  I could have easily said we were going to order an entree as I noted most outdoor patrons seemed to have \"claimed\" but I always prefer to be up front.  No matter how I tried to explain how illogical that this appeared to be, the hostess was not listening and continually repeated the management's rules as explained to her. She kept insisting that the restaurant would be breaking \"zoning laws\" and the restaurant would suffer from seating us outdoors.   In any case we sat inside and the waitress inside was wonderful. \n\nI guess salads, soups, and other appetizers don't count.  You definitely can't eat out side if you are a vegetarian...\n\nBut the inconsistency and the arrogance of many, not all, of the servers will probably keep me away.  Its a shame because the location and the food is great.","date":"2010-08-21 02:59:37"}

My mom loves this place so she wanted to go here. Originally I wasn't too enthusiastic. The food here is ok, but it's killer on the tract. \n\nSo we arrive around 6:15. they say an hour and 15 minute wait. Being the Saturday before Valentines Day we expect everywhere else in the area to be this packed (save Village Inn, but seriously, it's a birthday party, not a field trip from the nursing home). So we wait. 45 minutes later we ask the time and they say we have an hour left. (Mistake!) So realizing we should be on the home stretch and still having an hour left made us quite agitated, especially seeing people who at least appeared to be just walking in and getting tables. 15 later they say we had 35 minutes left, then at 10-15 minutes from that they call us up. I remind know that we need a high chair (as we had said our party was 4 + a high chair)... OOPS! The table they had set out for us was not capable of taking a high chair... So after being called up we stand around for 15 more minutes. But this time it was around 7:30 so Jeffy was getting extremely agitated. For half of the 15 minutes Jeffrey was screaming. Finally we were sat down. \n\nFelling still extremely angry and very ready to go home and lambaste this place on here (yes, I do plan my yelp posts while eating). To our surprise, (and to the chagrin of my angry side) the waitress shows up after a mere 3 minutes. So my mom in a strange bit of conversation starting gives the waitress a recount of our seating debacle, in a strange semi-happy semi-angry manner. The waitress kinda gives an awkward reaction, takes our drink order and leaves. Later the manager comes by and apologizes and offers to get us \"the biggest appetizer on the menu.\" Great. At a restaurant where the portions are already too big, more food isn't what we need. Either way we were still very pleased by the efforts to make us feel better. Later we learned that after our waitress got our drinks and listened to my mom's story she went straight to the manager and told him. \n\nBy the time we left we were feeling ok, except for the usual question feeling in my insides. The question is \"when am I going to have to run to the restroom, and will I make it home?\" \n\nOn a separate note. Definitely take some home.

I LOVED the Avalon... although when I used to go there for shows, I was too young to drink and thus could not be discouraged by expensive drink prices, and during most of the time I spent on Lansdowne I was attending gay night at either Avalon, Axis or Embassy (mostly Embassy). Now that the mainstream gay scene in Boston is mostly defunct, I was anxious to see what kind of monster replaced my beloved crappy-ass clubs.\n\nMy first thought was... holy security. They have at LEAST 15 dudes who get paid to stand down the street and point people toward the door. The entrance procedure is pretty... stupid. I don't see why you have a line of people using metal detecting wands, and no one scanning tickets. The scanners are right outside the door of the ballroom, and if you want to leave the ballroom and go out into the hallway, where the snacks are, two security people have to chase you down and put an X on your hand to grant you re-entry. You should have absolutely free reign to go between the hallway and the ballroom.\n\nThe coat check is FIVE DOLLARS (groan). I don't even think they charge five dollars for the coat check at expensive clubs like Rumor. I left really early so I had no problem getting my coat, but I'm sure it's a nightmare if you stay until the end of the show.\n\nAlso, if you're a smoker, prepare for hours upon hours without a cigarette. It made me fondly miss the strange fenced-in areas on the side of Avalon & Axis where you could smoke without technically leaving the building, and the smoker's balcony at Embassy. \n\nThe decor is strange, to say the least. I guess it's supposed to celebrate \"Unity in Diversity,\" but really, I don't understand what Buddhism has to do with Tom Jones or Lady GaGa. Drinks are kind of expensive, but what do you expect from a franchise venue like that? The second floor balcony is where you wanna be, in my opinion. It almost matches the Roxy balconies in viewing awesomeness. And, I have to say, the sound really is phenomenal in there. I will go again, I'm already planning on seeing The Faint\/Ladytron in April, but I'm only going for bands I really love. Otherwise, it's just so expensive and really not worth it. The Paradise and Middle East are just so superior in character.","date":"2009-03-01 20:01:07"}

The staff is super-attentive and hands-on with the dogs, and they truly do pay attention to any \"special instructions\" you have for your best friend. They are also good about keeping careful records of cell numbers and credit cards - so if your mom or best friend is bringing in or picking up the dog, you're all set and they'll make notes of whom to call. \n\nBottom line- I never worry about him when he's there, and that's worth evey penny!","date":"2008-08-18 16:34:05"}

Like an English Channel swimmer or a wrestler you may want to grease yourself up so you can squeeze through the crowded aisles with more ease.  \n\nTake a tip from the pros and think about doing some strength training so that you can do your shopping with baskets instead of a cart.  This will allow you greater mobility in getting around those tight corners and narrow passages between everyone else's carts.  \n\nAll good athletes know that timing plays a large part of the game.  For me, I've found that 4:45 on the weekdays works like a charm.  I rarely have to wait in line at checkout even when I have more than 12 things. (You'll notice that hardly anyone comes here for light shopping.  Carts are usually packed to an unsafe capacity.  So take advantage of the 12 items or less cashiers when you can.)  Avoid weekends here if you can, especially in the afternoon.\n\nThe thing that surprised me most about Market Basket was the high quality of their meats and produce.  Having just moved to this area after being around the corner from both TJ and WF I figured I was going to miss the quality of their products.  Surprisingly, I've become quite enamored with the wide range of selections they have here of their cuts of meat and both fresh fruits and veg.

We were seated immediately next to one of the buffets that was currently not in use.\n\nI went with the pho tai and it was okay. The bowl was not as big as others and the vegetables did not seem as fresh. It was okay and again, the price may have reflected this, as it was pretty cheap.

Not only was the meat amazing, there was a perfect amount of flavor (from the meat) and crunch (from the pickled onions) that just blended together wonderfully. Also, I love carbs (I mean who doesn't) and whatever bread they use for this sandwich is DELISH. Not sure if they grill the bread or what, but it's crunchy on the outside while super soft and fluffy on the inside (which is heaven). And, half the sandwich filled me up (although I lowkey just wanted to save it for the car ride home IT WAS TOO GOOD TO SIMPLY SCARF DOWN). Now what kind of friend would I be if I didn't also try the Chavela (a terrible one that's what) and dang that was good too! Pretty much a burrito bowl but healthier AND delicious.

I assume your name either Greg easterly\nAre you for real or you just work the maE next door ?\nYou paid $10 dollars and spent a couple ours with people catering to your unappreciative personality and you managed to critique even the parking attendant and everyone else who worked at  this farm maybe you belong at the next door miserable place with the miserable (EXPLETIVE DELETED)heads .\nNo insult intended just telling you what I think of your (EXPLETIVE DELETED) up review of a family farm\"\n\nedit again: Ooh, and another one, just minutes later, from \"Mario K.\" calling me \"retarded.\"  These guys just don't know when to stop digging.  \n\nA mature and well-reasoned response, surely.  Please read my detailed, specific review below.  Note that I am in no way affiliated with any competing business; I live an hour away and was visiting friends for the weekend.  \n\n***\n\nI was very disappointed in the haunted corn maze. I know the farm can't control the weather, but regardless, they were still charging full price for a maze where 3\/4 of the corn was laid down by the wind.  It wasn't so much a maze as an open field of mud and darkness, covered in 2-3 inches of water and knee-high corn stalks.  It was very slippery and generally miserable; it didn't seem like any effort had been made to mitigate the mud (no hay or barkdust or anything visible under the water).  Definitely not suitable for children or the elderly.    \n\nThe ticket lady told me that their real haunted maze had been flooded earlier in the day, so they were doing the scary stuff in their standard maze.  If that was the better-condition of the two mazes, then the other one must have been a literal swimming pool.\n\nEvery staff member I interacted with seemed overworked and snotty (with the exception of the people doing the scaring IN the maze - they were all great and making the best of a bad situation).  One parking attendant directed me to a handicapped parking area (not marked as such) and then yelled at me when I parked there.  A different attendant raised her voice and took a very sarcastic tone with my girlfriend for failing to stay on the \"pedestrian path\" through the parking lot (it was dark and poorly marked; there was no need for her tone).  The girl speaking over the PA system to make announcements sounded like the most bored, sarcastic teenager stereotype imaginable.  There was no attempt to create a festive or fun atmosphere. \n\nI also have to wonder at their decision to blast modern pop music over the PA system in the main area, because it carries over into the haunted maze and really ruins what little atmosphere remained.\n\nSince I assume that the corn won't magically stand itself back up after the wind storm, and I doubt that they'll be replacing their entire staff between now and Halloween, I would definitely skip this maze for the rest of the year.  I have heard that there are other locations on the same road, and I would definitely try one of those first, because they can't be any worse than Bella Organic Farm.","date":"2014-10-27 05:52:09"}

There are too many places in Atlanta with very good service, especially when you pay $250 just to sit...","date":"2018-01-21 17:59:11"}

They close by 3, and seem to often sell out even earlier in the day than that.\n\nKnowing how quick they go, I wisely made it a point for this to be the first stop of the day, for a very healthy breakfast. This allowed me to pick from all of the varieties, which actually made things so much harder since everything looks great.\n\nNot so wisely, we ended up getting a beastly 4 donuts for the 2 of us, which is not advisable before a big lunch. But it was fun. We got 3 of the massive yeast donuts (Chocolate Chipotle, Vanilla Bean and Hazelnut Butter Crunch) and the single cake donut they had, Pumpkin.\n\nThe yeast donuts are the way to go, and they were all great. I agonized over whether or not to get the Maple Bacon, but then I saw them bring out a new tray of the Vanilla Bean. There's nothing better\/more overwhelming than a fresh, hot doughnut straight from the fryer.\n\nDo not make the same mistake I did, and make sure you eat in (there is a decent amount of seating in the back) and ask for your donuts on a plate. The not so bright guy helping me put all my donuts in a single bag, so I was left with a really sticky mess. The super chocolatey Chipotle one got that melty chocolate all over the other donuts, and there were hazelnuts from the butter crunch one all over the vanilla bean. I didn't mind too much since everything still tasted great, but it was just a mess.\n\nI can't wait to visit Boston again and come here to start my day off right and spoil my appetite.","date":"2014-01-17 02:34:14"}

We had the Zucchini Pasta and Marinated Portobello Mushroom Steak with pesto sauce (next time I might try marinara) and the Fresh Addiction Burger. The Pasta is exactly as it sounds from the name, but that you don't really get a sense for how good it is just by reading the ingredients. The Burger has a manga guacamole-salsa, which is fantastic. It's a cucumber wrap style burger, so you won't really be eating it with your hands. It comes with eggplant bacon which was also quite good. The patty is a falafel patty.\n\nThe interior is cozy and relaxing. Nice wood tables and a wood tea bar.\n\nThe perfect rating I'm giving is based on the fact that the food is to die for.

First impressions rely on the people you get, and this place definitely gives you a warming welcome! \n\nWithin the counter area is a section where there's the usual sugar, creme, napkins area. There's a couple menus laid here for those who can't see the typical menu above the worker's head! Their menu offers the usual choices that coffee places offer, but also additional drinks that you usually wouldn't find or hear often. They offer many sizes for each drink, and the prices are affordable. \n\nI ordered the Breve (which I've been told is like a half and half) where you can pick whichever flavor you want. I got hazelnut and I'm pretty satisfied with my drink! They also put a piece of chocolate on top of your coffee cup (which I believe is the signature of their drinks), and who doesn't love a bite of chocolate? \n\nOverall, definitely a place I'll be visiting often where I love to seat near the windows and look outside while studying. I'm usually bothered by the music that usual coffee places play, but I don't put on my earbuds for this place to listen to the music. \n\nBeautiful wooden interior and exterior (aesthetics)? Check.

Nervous about leaving my 5 month old puppy (who I had never left before) with a \"stranger\", I was referred to Caliga. The trainer at Unleashed has promoted her services, and a friend of mine (who is also a client) gave me her name and number. The friend of mine who suggested Caliga travels out of the country frequently for business, and gave Caliga rave reviews. I trust her judgment and gave Caliga a call. She set up a \"meet and greet\" for my dog and I so that we could meet her before deciding whether or not she was a good fit. I thought that was a great idea! \n\nUpon entering my home, she got right down on the floor to say hello to my miniature dachshund. He (at the time) was very insecure around people he did not know, but warmed to her immediately. She focused 25 out of the 30 minutes of the visit just interacting with my dog and getting to know him. I know it might sound silly, but it put the both of us at ease. It also made a huge difference a few weeks later when I had to leave him with her for a week. His \"stay\" was successful and I have used Caliga ever since. \n\nNot only does she care for my dog (and the others) as if they were her own, she also is diligent with dispensing medication (should your pet need it), updating owners about the activities of the day and your pets disposition, and using the commands that I have been using while training my dog. He is now so comfortable walking with a pack (which I attribute to her), and does not return to me having forgotten the skills we have been working on. Every time she picks him up he is excited to go, and he always makes sure to say hi to her, should we come across her while on our walks. He truly loves her and I know she loves him. \n\nIt is a shame that the people leaving negative reviews have never retained Caliga. I think it is despicable to leave such horrible comments on a small business owner's page who you have NEVER actually done business with. Observations are one thing - but the fact that all of her clients and their pets love her is another. Those of us who do not have friends equip to take care of our pets, or do not have friends, family, or a significant other in the area really depend on her. I would hate to see her get a bad rap because of the things other people have \"run across\" or \"observed\". Lighten up!","date":"2016-07-14 20:24:54"}

It's really funny how I asked an employee for an ash tray and he gave me a cup instead then several minutes later one of the staff peeps out the door and says \"sorry guys you can't smoke at the table\" so me being understanding and reasonable I don't create a problem.

We arrived a little later in the evening and there was barely a line.  I grabbed a menu and considered the obligatory fried chicken until I saw the Smothered Pork Chops behind the sneeze guard.  I ordered them with a side of \"Hoppin' John\" (a mixture of various beans and stewed tomatoes), french fries, and hush puppies.  I also added a dessert; the mini banana creme pie.  The pork chop from my entree was HUGE, bone-in and served on a bed of white rice.  I ordered the \"Generous\" portion that included the 3 side-items (instead of 2 for the \"Plenty\" portion) and cornbread.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  We paid and went to sit down in the family-style seating area.  Apparently when really busy it's encouraged to share tables with your neighbors.  I dove right in to the Hoppin' John; it was not what I was expecting... It was bland, with the textures and ingredients I was expecting something different I guess.  Then onto the pork chop - it was \"smothered\" in a thick mushroom gravy; the first bite was underwhelming and also unexpectedly un-flavorful.  These dishes lacked the \"Soul\" in Soul Food\/Southern cuisine.  The french fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The Hush Puppies were in one word - PHENOMENAL.  Arguably the best I've ever had, fried perfectly, freshly made and extremely delicious.  Now onto the cornbread... At first glance it looks good, but once you pick it up and realize how heavy and dense with grease it is; it becomes very unappetizing very quickly.  I could only take one bite before putting it down and never returning for another taste.  It was the size and weight of a yellow grease-soaked hockey puck.  The mini banana creme pie was delicious and dense with real banana flavor. \n\nI would return to try other menu items.","date":"2014-07-13 18:46:20"}

I didn't want to write a negative review after my first experience (which was horrible), so I decided to give it a second shot. First time I was here, I had the chicken burrito. It was so bland. If you're going to put rice and beans in all your burritos, make sure they're well seasoned. Their onions are just very huge sloppy chunks. I felt like I was just biting into onions. For my second visit, I decided to go with their popular pork and Chile burrito, chicken quesadilla, nachos with the meat chili and guacamole. Burrito was once again super bland. Half of it didn't even have any meat in it, I thought they accidentally made the vegetarian one. Once I got to the meat, it was once again flavorless... the nachos came out with no meat chili which I had to pay $4 something extra for (good thing I checked my box before I left). The quesadilla was super soggy and dripping with liquid. The guac was under seasoned and didn't even have cilantro in it. Just overall another horrible experience.

Will not be returning! I am the ideal patient that has no cavities, teeth work, or problems. My whole appointment was just one awful thing after another. \n\n1. Upon my arrival I'm told they don't have a hygienist so someone else will be doing my exam. Why would you schedule my appointment on a day there is no hygienist when I need a cleaning? \n2. Assistant spent half an hour taking my x-rays because she couldn't get the machine placement correct. Do you know how uncomfortable it is to hold that contraption in your mouth because someone else isn't getting the camera position correctly.\n3. Assistant immediately began polishing my teeth and snagged my lip in the tool. First off, why are you polishing my teeth when my teeth haven't even been cleaned yet? Also, as the person polishing my teeth, why are you not maneuvering my lip away from my teeth so you can polish the front of them without spinning my lip into your tool.\n4. The dentist? or whomever Anna Nguyen is, returned to actually clean my teeth, and used the ultrasonic. That's fine, however the assistant was not paying attention and continued to suction my throat rather than the water coming from the tool. She also would look away causing her hand to move to then suction my lip or cheek instead of liquid.\n5. Once the cleaning was complete the assistant returned to struggling to polish my teeth and then flossed. At this time she missed both of my back molars but I did not say anything because I plan to just floss them myself and get out of there. \n6. Lastly, I opted in the beginning of the appointment prior to knowing that the experience was going to be less than professional, for varnish to be put onto two teeth. The assistant proceeded to dab the varnish all over all my teeth, getting it onto my lips and piles of the product on  my teeth.  My lips are still sticky 2 hours later. \n\n I really wanted to like this place but it seems that it's a bunch of newly graduates or maybe interns working here.  The two who handled my appointment today were not even on their website as part of their \"Team\". Long story short, I will not be returning and I hope that no one else deals with the same.\n\nThe Pro's I can say is their front desk seems very knowledgeable, in particular their insurance specialist and the business itself seems very up-to-date with everything being digital.","date":"2016-04-11 17:49:59"}

Architecturally clean, great patio, slick yet casual bar on the inside, decent wine selection.  But this Hyde Park grill got me thinking:  part of the charm of dining out in Austin is the same thing that can make restaurants here an occasional challenge to review, that is, that the very best local service here is prompt (yet casual), attentive (but not snooty).  And while no one could argue that the new Hyde Park Grill offers a visually simple and appealing approach to dinner, our service was more casual than attentive, our food more adequate than outstanding.  It's a fine line to walk, and not everyone does it well.\n\nMany in our dining party attempted to harden arteries right away:  there were chicken-fried entrees, plenty of cracked pepper fries to go around.    Here's an excerpt from an actual conversation on that front:\n\nUs: so, um, what are you guys known for?  What's good here?\nWaitress: (shrugs) the fries, I guess.\n\nThis is one of those situations where you really wish you could give extra half-stars, as some of the shenanigans going on outside during our dinner had nothing to do with the restaurant itself (some guy at a nearby table fighting with his girlfriend or parole officer, repeatedly jumping the patio railing and standing on his car in the parking lot...seriously, it was odd), and our food certainly wasn't awful.  But it wasn't great.   Let's hope Hyde Park south works a little harder to bottle some of the magic that's made the original so popular.","date":"2007-05-17 14:40:00"}

Zero. Zip. Nada. Forget that breakfast is usually the easiest meal to custom make- that often they take 2 minutes to cook eggs and make it to order.  Forget the fact that my friend was a vegetarian. They will not make any substitutions.  When my friend begged them to leave the bacon off at they would not. When she asked for tomatoes instead, they said she could order them on the side for 3.95.  3.95??? And that is what she did and they literally gave her a saucer with tomatoes.  \n\nOn top of this our waitress was soooo rude about it.  Terrible.  I mean it was unusual - I have never been to a restaurant that refused to make any substitutions for breakfast  and her attitude towards my friend was almost as bad as, \"well, you shouldn't be a vegetarian.\" Despite my food being good, I haven't gone back and I'm not sure i will.

Some of these are hits (caramelized onions on flat bread, goat cheese on salads) and some are misses (who tastes the truffle in the aioli served with the fries? why pretend to eat vegetables and order the eggplant 'chips'? calamari....again?) \n\nThere are quite a few pleasant surprises: \n-The Chili Oil that comes with the Flatbread appetizer and on the Ring of Fire pizza - spicy, deliciousness \n\n-Baby Arugula Salad - the lemon-basil vinaigrette is fantastic, the greens are fresh, and the toppings are well-balanced \n\n-The White Pizza - while nothing new, it is executed with delicious cheese, and a lovely charred, yet chewy crust \n\n-The best surprise: the bar.

During the summers, our family goes here for brunch often on Sunday afternoons.  They make the best french toast I've had anywhere!\n\nThe place is family owned and run, and possibly overwhelmed with so much family to care for while running a restaurant, it's rather obvious I agree.  On Sunday afternoons their teenage daughter is often the waitress, she's sweet and shy, the atmosphere is pretty authentic and unique for a Cambridge restaurant.\n\nEating here is like eating at a friend's house, it's not for everyone, I have personally witnessed the service issues, and I can't disagree it could be better, it also depends on the day.  However, I'm also not usually in a rush when I come, it's a family meal, we come to relax and enjoy ourselves over a good meal.  \n\nThe food I've had here makes up for the service and has always been good.  It's probably also the cheapest eat in town, for a table of three we often only spend $10 before tipping (we tip well, it's a family owned business).\n\nSummers are best here, we can enjoy the seating outside, enjoy the breeze on a sunny day, people watch, and be served outside.  I am all for supporting a local family owned and run business.","date":"2011-03-20 20:36:49"}

He is very focused in helping you achieve your dance goals, as long as you articulate it. He'll also introduce you to new dance styles (if you're focused on one style like me). I like Leon because he not only teaches you at the studio, but he'll also connect with you outside the studio - and this speaks to a person who is serious about improving their dance technique like me. He'll check in with you outside of studio time, provide you with dance resources to make sure you get a certain concept right if it wasn't grasped during your lesson, and make you fully understand the culture of dance (if you care for it)! Receiving lessons from Leon is a pleasure because he not only has a passion for dancing, but you know that he really cares about his students.\n\nOutside of private lessons, Leon hosts outings to various salsa clubs in Boston and Cambridge (usually it's Havana Club in Cambridge). I don't take his salsa classes, but I've gone out with him and his students and it's always a good time. \n\nLastly, he also hosts a dance video blog (www.passion4dancing.com) where he'll teach certain dance techniques. It's a true testament to his comprehensive teaching style.","date":"2011-07-28 13:54:20"}

We were out all day, and busy so we were starving! We picked up our pizzas and drove home which isn't to far about 10 minutes away. Anyways when we got home, I took a bite out of the hand pan pizza and it was completely raw!!! The dough wasn't even cooked, and I almost gagged! How in the world can someone give their customer an undercooked raw pizza! It's just awful! So naturally we called to let them know about the situation and asked if they could deliver the new pizzas to us, since it was their fault for messing up in the first place! Well long story short, they said they wouldn't because they did not deliver to our address, even though it was literally 10 minutes down the road in the next city over! So my husband decided he would just go grab the new pizzas...Well 30 minutes later my husband comes home with the new pizzas and guess what.....they were undercooked and RAW!!!! At this point I was just fed up, so I called dominos back, and told them they once again sold me undercooked pizzas...so the girl on the phone puts her manager on the phone, and I explained the situation. The manager then tells me she personally made the pizza and if she kept it in the oven any longer it would have burned! I told her well then you need to be re-taught how to make a pan pizza because what they should be doing to avoid it from burning the toppings or being undercooked is putting the dough in alone to cook a bit and then taking it out adding the toppings and putting it back in to cook! Clearly dominos needs to retrain these employees at this location! Anyways point to this story is my husband had to go back a third time for new pizza! While the other pizzas got cold! They didn't even want to credit us for the pizzas but they made sure we brought the other undercooked pizzas back! Like seriously they make me laugh!!! What are they going to do resell the pizza that should be trashed? What a joke! Needless to say, I contacted corporate and I hope they take this matter seriously because as a customer and for this huge inconvience they should do something! Anyways do not go to this location unless you want raw dough for your meal!","date":"2017-03-27 04:58:43"}

Just a 5 minute drive from Harvard Square, it was cozy and informal, and reminded me of Italian restaurants in smaller towns and cities there, such and Parma. \n\nThe owner actually came over, took our order, and served us. That was a nice treat. He's from Napoli, and he was extremely accommodating. I spotted a man at a table on the other side of the room eating what turned out to be a squid-ink pasta with seafood. We managed to snag the very last one available after the owner rushed over to put the order in. \n\nWe had an excellent cheese, prosciutto and figs anti-paste; squid-ink pasta; and hanger steak with Brussels sprouts and potatoes. A great added thing was they split the pasta and steak into two small dishes for us. For dessert with had chocolate tort with hazelnut gelato, and a tiramisu. \n\nSquid ink seafood pasta with shrimps was the best. Hanger steak was very good. The ambience was laid back and comfy. \n\nOverall, an authentic Italian eatery without any pretentiousness whatsoever. A gem, just as it was said to be. We'll be returning soon. But please don't go!

This place is STILL a definite must-eat if you are from Austin. \n\nI took away a star and gave it 4 stars because of the wait. If you decide to go around 6-8pm (any day of the week) be prepared for a WAIT! The line goes out the door, wraps around the building, and then some. The ordering\/seating system is also a little confusing for first-timers, I can't even try and explain it, but be ready to be mildly confused if it's your first time there.\n\nI also only gave it 4-stars because I don't know if I can give it 5-stars since the four times I've eaten there I've eaten the exact same burger... now, is that a bad thing? No, I think it might say a lot for Hopdoddy's since I'm so in love with this burger I can't even try other burgers. GREEK BURGER is where it's at. I'm a fan of Greek food in general, and to combine Greek + Burger into one beautiful mash-up? Heavenly. \n\nSo I don't know if that gives me the right to properly review this place. I think the problem with this place is that each burger is so good in its own right, once you try one burger, you can't stop eating that same burger... my boyfriend did the same thing with the Terlingua. He got it the first time, and the next two times he went, the burger was just so good he couldn't even bother try any of the others!\n\nThe boyfriend is in love with the Kennemec (spelling?) fries. Me? I think they aight! Sometimes they're really salty, and sometimes they're just perfect. I think the herb-y stuff they sprinkle on the fries makes it really stand out from other fries at burger places. \n\nI suggest if you go here, you go at like 5-5:30PM to beat the rush. And try and go in a big group and have everyone get different burgers, that way you have the opportunity to take a bite into other burgers to try them out. Don't be like me... stuck with the same delicious burger each time I go... woe is me!","date":"2012-03-30 02:10:05"}

There was not much of breadcrumbs in their casserole.  Great for people who are in to low-carb diet.  :)    The casserole had just a touch of fat.

They did their casserole well.\n\nFor dessert, I had their tiramisu.  It was very good also, comparable to the restaurants that I usually eat in the Financial District where I work.  Yes, there's nothing special about their tiramisu but that's because they did it as good as the more expensive restaurants downtown.\n\nOne thing that I like about this restaurant is that they serve fine foods but it does not feel that you're coming to a restaurant that serves snotty crowd.

I've had plenty of cats in my time from kittens to elderly so I know my way around cats and how to care for them. The funny thing is that we walked into the store looking to buy fish for my partner, but me being a cat person and my partner being an animal lover, we decided to get a cat instead.\n\nSome of the employees seemed better prepared for us to adopt our little Shadow from here than others, and the ones that seemed knowledgeable on how to handle the situation were the ones shelving or at the register. The duty of instructing us on our cat's adoption then fell to an employee that was incredibly shy and soft-spoken. He let us handle each of the cats for us to find the right fit which I was thankful for, but when I asked him about each of the cats he said he only really knew what was on their cards and not the cats themselves as individuals.\n\nI had my heart set on finding an orange tabby or calico, but their selection was limited to other cats which was more of what my partner wanted- hence the reason why we adopted our tuxedo cat Shadow.\nMy apartment wasn't cat-ready so much as fish-ready at the time of adoption, so I asked if we could reserve our cat for adoption (I've done this adopting cats at other PetSmart locations in Texas) so that I could get the place ready for a cat- the entire time this employee is communicating via headset to the knowledgeable female employee that had greeted us who was busy shelving near the fish. He says that this location is unable to put an adoption on hold\/make a reservation, and my partner is already too set on adopting the cat today anyway (despite never caring for a cat before or understanding the work that goes into it). \n\nOnce we started filling out our paperwork to adopt our cat, the man gave us a bunch of coupons to get us started on getting all the supplies we needed which I was really happy about. I ask him where to find cat carriers to transport our cat to the car and he seemed really unsure and just pointed us to the cat area before walking off.\n\nSo aside from my experience with that particular employee, and then with the employees in the grooming department (long story short our cat's fur was a mess so I wanted them to at the very least shampoo it clean again) which also weren't very helpful, I like this location's Banfield Pet Hospital which has been very helpful to us, but that's about it.","date":"2018-10-04 15:11:16"}

When you are inside it's a bit more hit or miss - the music is pretty loud electronica and only one table has decent light (best to decide if you want either a dark cozy place OR one with light).  Dinner in the past has been quite good and they do have a coupon in the Chinook book.  Happy hour food is lackluster - the sweet potato fries were okay, and the calamari was equally average, although they got personal points from me for only serving the rings and not the 'spiders' as we call them, ha.  However offering two types of dipping sauces (not just one spicy sauce) would be recommended to compliment various palettes.  Increase the variety and quality of the happy hour food and Mint would rock.  Definitely would choose this over the White Eagle next door!!!","date":"2009-10-13 18:52:29"}

It's so rare to have a space like this, and I loved the fact that I was studying under the beautiful blue skies and natural light.

The double espresso was pulled perfectly both times I ordered, and with a touch of brown sugar, brought out the bright and tangy flavors (not too much acidity, I love it!). The quiche was not as warm as I would have liked it, but I loved the single portion style of it, with the amazing crunchy crust that holds the whole thing together.\nService: I think the fact that they bring out your drinks to you is a great touch to the shop.

It's creamy, but not in a gross way like some chicken salads are -- AKA they don't go overboard with mayo. To add onto this flavor train, the dressing they give you on the side is rather magical. It's a semi-sweet, ginger dressing. I can't put my finger on the entire flavor profile, but it is perfect. I used it in moderation to not overpower any of the other flavors, but man they do it right.

We will make do as this will be our last night of a seven night. We missed breakfast.  I called room service for a pot of coffee.  I wait 30 it does not show up.  So i call to check on it.  Tondra who is very sweet said she has not record of room service.  She took my order for a pot of coffee and 15 minutes later I get coffee.  Five minutes after I get another knock at the door and its Tondra with coffee.  I tell her they just came.  She said how much did they charge you.  I told her it was 9.00.  She said it came from the hotel next door which buena vista also owns and that it why it took so long she said they should have told me.  They didn't .  Tondra assures me I will not get charged twice.  Tondra and Carlos were the only good things about this hotel.  There are so many hotels near Disney you have many choices.  I highly recommend you steer clear of this place.","date":"2015-10-23 16:00:05"}

However, the convenience of making an appointment online, current promotions, and location gave me the push to visit them for the first time. I am very pleased with my experience and the level of service. They reported that the brakes were at 6-70% but, as I already suspected, it needed a full strut\/shock job at 4 corners. The avg for such is $175-250 a corner, and with all the promotions from them and the manufacturer, I ended up with labor, tax, etc at about $182 a corner, so it felt like a great deal. They were quick and communicated well. Lastly, they forgot the LOF, and were apologetic, but not a problem, we had some time before it was needed. However, thanks to Chris who followed up with a call and a generous offer to LOF for free. Also he mailed some 10% coupons. I'll be back, and appreciate the customer service, which really defines the experience. Let's face it, anyone can do an LOF. It is the service that makes me return.

I find that touchless car washes, despite being more gentle on a vehicle (perhaps too gentle), tend to waste water and leave a lot of dirt behind.\n\nRichmond Auto Wash offers automated car washes at three price points, Simple (\"Complete Ultrasoft-Touch, Exterior Wash & Dry\") for $10, Regular (\"Basic Wash, Triple Foam, Ice Instant Shine\") for $13, and The Works (\"Triple Foam, Ice Instant Shine, Tire Shine, Rust Buster\") for $15.  Admittedly, I don't know the actual difference between the features offered.  I had purchased a voucher online for the Simple Wash and chose to upgrade to The Works.  I always go for the premium option when it comes to automated car washes since you can't really expect an automated car wash to get your car absolutely clean if it's dirty - only a hand car wash can do that.\n\nThey don't offer an add-on for vacuuming, though they do offer hand car wash\/detailing service which includes vacuuming.\n\nThere was only one car in front of me when I drove up on a weekday afternoon.  Service was friendly, one of the attendants looked over my car when it came out and told me about their current promotions, and my car came out pretty clean (though the tires were not as shiny as they were when I took it to Shine Auto Wash, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/shine-auto-wash-vancouver).  The wash itself felt a little rough, but I didn't notice any damage to my car, so it may have been just me.\n\nIt's definitely the best automated car wash in Richmond.","date":"2014-05-07 17:55:39"}

The waitress was attentive and we did not have to wait very long at all after ordering. For my meal, I chose the pollo empanada and a small organic spinach salad. Both were fantastic! The salad was delicious, especially the dressing, and the empanada with chimichurri sauce was flavorful and a fair size for it's price. Most of our group went for the empanada + salad combination, but some opted for the gnocchi and loved it. I tried a bite of the pumpkin gnocchi--it could almost pass for a dessert. \n\nSpeaking of dessert, while I didn't try any, the birthday girl ordered a white and dark chocolate berry tart (and it ended up being complimentary which was a nice touch).

Here is where things start to go south.\n\n I met my stylist and she was very nice- I won't say her name because I really don't want her to get into trouble. She asked me what I was thinking of doing with my hair and I explained that since I did have very long hair I did want a cut that was more substantial than a trim and I gestured to her on my body about how long I wanted the cut, which was about to my mid-chest level. This would have been a cut around 6 inches. Remember that I came in with waist length hair. She said \"wow that is a dramatic cut\" and I said \"Well it's not that bad, I will still have length\" and she agreed and I didn't think anything of it. Looking back this should have been a blaring red alarm. I also said \"I was thinking of bangs in the front\" and she dismissed me with \"no I wouldn't do bangs on you.\" \n\n So first she gave me a one minute shoulder massage which I was not expecting and was actually kind of painful because I was tense. After this she led me to the basin and washed my hair and did a nice scalp massage. Then she took me to the chair and got started. She was asking me some kind of small talk question- like where I'm from or something- when she started making the first cut and this was the end of my long hair. I guess there was a miscommunication where she didn't understand how long I wanted my hair? Or maybe she wasn't thinking and just did it from muscle memory? I have no idea. I wish that I had vocally stated where I wanted my hair to be in length because unfortunately the stylist cut almost an entire foot of my hair off. There was no going back- she cut the entire length off with the first snip. \n\n The only thing I can do is beg the salon to implement a policy of when someone comes in with very long hair, to please show the amount of hair about to be cut and confirm that it is okay to cut so much off. This could have been prevented if she had shown me the amount she was about to cut, but it was too late. I was staring at my reflection and I stopped talking and she noticed this. My hair went from past waist-length to just above my collarbone. She did some choppy layers and the haircut would have been very nice if it was what I wanted, but it's not at all remotely what I wanted and I was so proud of my long hair and it is all gone now. She cut so much off that the highlights\/balayage I had in my hair were cut completely out as well and my hair is all monotone. I did not saying anything because realistically it was too late and there is nothing anybody can do- my hair can't be reattached. I went home and cried. The last time I had my hair this short was when I was in high school and I hated it as much then as I do now.  I will have to wait the year or more for my hair to grow back. When it does, I don't think I will risk going back. So, PLEASE, Van Michael- have your stylists confirm when they think a dramatic cut is about to happen.","date":"2018-07-26 14:47:48"}

This is not fussy dining but solid comfort food with a southern flair. We ate here for happy hour which I highly recommend. The value is really good. Good quality food at a reasonable cost. I had the small chicken and dumplings, my wife had the fish and chips and our friend who lives in the couve but grew up in Louisiana had the fried tomatoes. My chicken and dumplings were a  5\/5. The execution was great. As others have said, a little more chicken would be great, but the dumplings were awesome. The fish and chips and fried tomatoes were 4\/5. Our friend mentioned that if the tomatoes were more tart it would have been perfect, probably a seasonal thing. They tasted good to me but I didn't grow up in the south The service was great. I opted to rate this 5\/5 because in this price range, this is really good food and value. It is clean and pretty nice on the inside and the food, drinks and service are pretty good too. The menu is not huge, it's a little bit of a drive and it doesn't look like much from the outside, but if you are looking for a place to get some really good comfort food without the high cost and attitude, this is it.

I'll put that to the lack of wait staff. \nThe pork bao were nice but not amazing, the chewy meat with the chewy bun wasn't a great mix. And not enough salad. Perhaps some crunchy cabbage would have gone better for freshness and texture. \n\nThe fried chicken was a disappointment, the batter was too thick and oily. But the chicken itself was nice. It's nothing like a proper Korean friend chicken which is much lighter and clean. \n\nAll up the meal was okay and at the prices you can't complain.

You may say, well kid that's pretty much normal anywhere you go on a busy night. But the fact is the place is not crowded at all. The entire design of the bar was horribly added into the space provided. It takes way too long to get a drink in here and you constantly have people on top of one another trying to get one. Then a big table is situated right in front of the bar, which limits people from getting to the bar. These are just some of the issues with the layout.

This year I am taking it down a notch due to a few things. First, I know we need increased security now, so we can feel and be safe. Universal gets it wrong however by herding the whole crowd through a woefully meager number of check points. Last night, a Sunday, not peak, that process added over 30 minutes to the getting in the park process. Then they had the ticket windows operating extra, super slow. That addes 45 minutes to the wait. So we were witing in lines about 1.5 hours, just to get in. Other than that it is the same fun. You can ride some of the rides and go into the scare houses. It takes all night to do it with the express pass. I still enjoyed it and will return next year, but this year was not quite as good as last year. Too much waiting around and the in the park scare zones were not as good.","date":"2012-10-08 16:44:05"}

That's the only reason it's busy.  As mentioned by other reviewers, their food is \"OK\", but not great.  If you're expecting a Snarfs or even a Quiznos, you'll be disappointed.  Also they have recently repainted with brighter colors, but it still gives off an \"institutional\" vibe - they should hang some photos or add some real decorations.\n\nI also echo what others have said about service, I asked for something slightly custom (one of their subs on Panini bread instead of on a sub roll) and the cashier made a point to say that they don't usually do that, but she asked the sandwich-maker and they both said \"OK\".  Great, I tipped an extra buck and looked forward to my sandwich on nice crispy panini bread on this cold winter day.  Ten minutes later (yes, that's the standard wait time), my number comes up, and it's a regular sub.  Seriously disappointing.  The order-delivery person said they could re-make it but my co-workers already had their food and I didn't want to wait yet another ten minutes.  Very dissapointing, and a good reminder of why I avoid this place unless I really have no other options.\n\nAlso rating them low because I heard that they were complaining to the city about the food trucks which are starting to stop by the office park, cutting into their business.  I'm sorry, that's called capitalism - the appropriate response is to improve the quality of your food so that you can compete for that business, not ask the government to ban competition and leave you with a weak product.","date":"2011-10-27 19:15:21"}

My boyfriend and I have tried the peanut butter burger and the bender burger. Both were pretty good, but the PB was definitely the better one! We've tried the PB twice now, once with mayo and once without. It tasted a little too heavy with that extra mayo and it seemed to take away from the PB sauce. I thought it tasted good either way, but it made me feel a little bit better about myself to get it without mayo. One thing that I like is the bottomless fries! When I ordered my burger I asked for fries as well, but all of their burgers actually come with fries. The fries are really good, too. My favorite thing about their menu is that you can order a half-size burger, which they call making it \"girlie.\" This miniature burger looked really small at first but it ended up being the perfect amount of food. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because our wait was SO LONG. When we ordered our food, there was no line in front of us... we walked right up to the cashier.

When we pulled up at about 8:45 there was only a single car there, which belonged to an employee. We thought they were closed for a moment, but they just had no customers on a Friday night. \n\nOnce inside it was a nifty place - arcade games, skee ball, air hockey, crane machines, etc. Kids and kids at heart would love this place! The mini golf course is lit with black lights and all of the paint glows. The monster theme is cute and they have a couple of animatonic monsters that are fun. Even though the course is almost  completely flat it was still pretty challenging. A round of golf here will run you about $7.50.\n\nWe had a great time, but it was really HOT in there...so hot that by the time we finished playing everyone was either \"dewy\" (girls don't sweat!) or actively dripping with sweat. The A\/C seemed to be on, but it was not keeping the place cool. I am not sure what was going on with that, but it definitely made us golf and leave quickly instead of lingering to play games and hang out. \n\nThe course was challenging and they did a great job painting and making the place look good. It is obvious that someone put a lot of effort into designing the course and the monsters. Ultimately, I still think Putting Edge in Festival Bay is a better and more interesting course...and best of all sufficiently air conditioned! \n\nI would go to Monster Mini Golf again, because, with the exception of the heat I really enjoyed it...but based on their terrible location I will be surprised if they will be able to survive here.

However, it isn't nearly as comprehensive as other presidential museums. \n\nThe museum begins with the 1960 convention and election season. There are some cool signs and television footage from the campaign. You can even read the original text of his inauguration speech. From there, the museum becomes a random collection of letters and gifts the Kennedys received while in the White House. The assassination is glossed over with news footage announcing his death, and the remainder of the museum is dedicated to Kennedy's legacy.\n\nGiven the Kennedy legacy, I expected more stories and items. There was very little mentioning of JFK's childhood, his relationship with Jackie, his children, or his Congressional career. Nothing negative about Kennedy was on display, which is unusual for a presidential museum. At both the Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford museums, the good and the bad are addressed. You also walk away feeling as if you got to know the men they were.\n\nOverall, the museum is certainly worth visiting, but there is certainly room for improvement.","date":"2016-08-04 01:50:48"}

The First Time.   Waitress took it back to have it corrected and once again it came back well done.  I'm normally not a picky eater but honestly this steak was not edible.  I also ordered the mashed potatoes as a side.  They were mashed and came with bacon and what appeared to be a slice of Kraft American cheese that they took the wrapper off of and laid on top.  Very disappointing!  For a restaurant to charge the prices they do you would think they would do better than that. The real kicker for me was the fact that the manager never came by one time to check on our table after we had sent a steak back twice.  Instead, our waitress offered us a free dessert.  In the end, we paid for a steak and potatoes we didn't eat and we will never go back there again.  Poor customer service!!!","date":"2016-03-07 14:46:15"}

I've read previous reviews that people actually wait for these coupons for Mis trucos because it seem they do them often. That is definitely not a good reputation to have, but I do agree that their portions are kind of small and you do need many dishes to be satisfied.\n\nAfter reading reviews of how previous coupon-ers were ill treated, I made sure to not book my reso through Open Table and call in for a reservation to state that I had a coupon for 2 six course tastings. I thought they wanted this because I bet they changed the items that went on the menu to accommodate for the cheaper coupon. This wasn't so as we were serve exactly what was on the chalkboard wall for the 6 course taster - except for the dessert which apparently they ran out of.\n\nAgree with past reviews that food does not come out hot, but lukewarm. Sous vide chicken was barely palatable at room temperature, which wasn't that well seasoned, although the quinoa with apricots and almonds on which it was served was perfect. (5th course)\n\n1st course was a shot of gazpacho with spot prawn and avocado. Latter could have been more ripe, which would have added better richness and sweetness. \n\n2nd was amazing - a parma ham with caramelized onions and red pepper, topped with a 60 degree poached egg, making it not runny, but more jelly like in consistency. It was amazing tasting, although points off for messy presentation (runny egg white outside of where the egg even was). This was also served room temp.\n\n3rd was the risotto. I was sad to see that it was a truffle risotto instead of lobster, but in a 6 course tasting that was so cheap, it's udnerstandable (their lobster risotto is amazing). I think I make pretty amazing mushroom truffle risotto myself, and I have to say mine might be a tiny bit better. Their rice was too al dente. Truffle flavour was there, but not amazing.\n\n4th course was the fish - a tiny piece, but it was simply seared with a crispy skin. Accompaniments weren't memorable. \n\n5th course was chicken which I mentioned earlier in lukewarmness.\n\n6th was dessert and was supposed to be a chocolate mousse which the boyfriend was looking forward to, but they arrived with a rhubarb sauced rice pudding instead, with no mention to the change on the blackboard or to us, until something different was served to us. The rhubarb sauce was yummy nonetheless, and I appreciate the local seasoned produce addition, although again the rice was hard and it felt like it had been in the fridge for a while. Definitely not made that day. \n\nShared a pitcher of sangria for 17 bucks and that was quite yummy, albeit a tad watered down. \n\nAll in all, it was a good experience and wish I could give it 3 and a half stars. Yes the furniture, pitcher, glasses, silverware and lots of other things are from Ikea, but the boyfriend noted it's kind of a cool thing that you can open a restaurant on the cheap because you're passionate about food. yes, but I wish the delicious food was actually made fresh and served at a good temperature! \n\nWould go back for small plates and drinks as a predinner thing.","date":"2011-05-27 19:25:43"}

First, I tried calling Checker repeatedly during the late afternoon, always getting a generic message that said that no one was available to take my call.  I left a message, with no call back.  I then used the online booking tool that allowed me to book a cab. I received a that said I ordered a cab at 7:37 pm.  I was trying to get to a concert at the Lakewood Amphitheater, which started at 8pm.  I received a text that my cab was NOT dispatched, and placed another \"order,\" via Taxi Magic and was told via text that the cab was dispatched.  After another 20 minutes, I decided to just drive.\n\nI just want to know:  why are cab companies, especially affiliated with Taxi Magic, not available via phone, and why are they not jumping at a cab fare that would be around $35 with tip????","date":"2012-05-28 22:06:59"}

The broth is so good and there's so much tofu it's a very filling meal. I've seen some of the sizzling kalbi go by and it looks and smells amazing, but I can't seem to get myself to order anything other than the soup. I love it. I've had the kimchi soup and that was good. Lots of small bits of beef and enough kimchee to finish off the meal. The seafood soup was good, but pretty skimpy on the seafood. The head-on shrimp made for a great broth, but too much work to eat. I also love the fresh egg that comes along side the meal. Next time i'll have to ask for an extra. \n\nThere really is no ambiance. It's got a rather dull interior to be honest. But they're not here to give you a top-ranked hotel restaurant with damask printed silk and tuxedo waiters. It's freakin' next to Fubonn... on 82nd... in the middle of Felony Flats. They put their time and effort where it counts - in the food! What surprises me is that there's actually a GREAT Korean place in the middle of Chinaland.

It was the three soup hot pot that caught my attention.  That was why we came here to try it out despite the so so reviews.  Thanks to local celebs Chelsea and Pam.  Best thanks to Fellow Yelpers who posted this place. (Btw Chelsea and Pam are from the YouTube show HBICTV. Go watch it) \nNow...\nDespite what I've read, the service was decent.  Our server spoke both Chinese and English.  So if any of you hipsters want to try it out, it's pretty easy. ( remember don't be afraid to ask for stuff )\n\nThe menu is AYCE priced just under $21 with a listing of items available to order.  Below that there are items that are not pert of the AYCE menu like the soup options from $9.99 to $14.99. Your choice of one soup, two soups or three soups.  We opted for the three soup option.  \nThere were also some appetizers to choose from and a list of drinks and sauces.\n\nExpect to pay at least $30\/person.\n\nVeggies - decent selection good quality\nMeat slices - pork was freezer burnt but the other meats were ok if not paper thin. \nLamb was the exception and was thicker and not frozen.\nVegetarian options are good, but not Vegan. \n\nThe soups we ordered were \n1) spicy chili - oily but spicy but not Chongqing style.  \n2) Tomato we all liked that the best.\n3) chicken \n\nHow to order your hot pot items? Just put a tick next to the item you want.  If you need more later, just ask for it. \nNeed more soups? Ask.\nNeed plates? Ask. \n\nOverall, I give them 3 stars which for AYCE is decent.  Our meal between the six of us was $32 Cash each.  And yes it's Cash only.  \n\nSecret tip for eating Chinese food and getting service?  Ask. \n\nThis review was written all thumbs up. Literally!!!

The cheeseburger thing has happened twice now.\n\nThe fries - for the 5th visit in a row, the fries were near inedible.  I'm not sure if they're always overcooked, just sitting around too long, or a combination of the two.  It seems I can't get fresh fries unless I visit during the peak of lunch rush.\n\nAll of that is a shame - Wendy's is my preferred fast food burger chain, and this is the location closest to my house.

I was freezing cold and I didn't want to ruin my dinner with Tracey S. So, I ordered the 4\" pecan pie ($5). It was so yummy and it was not as sweet as other pies I had before. \n\nNext day, I had The Wake-Up Call Burger. It came with a sunny-side up and the yolk created a dripping mess as I bit to it.

She was appreciative. \n\nI've never been to their previous location. After I saw the photos from last biz page, I like this location at Mueller Lake Park.

Years ago I purchased a leather sectional couch here for approx $4,000.  (Perhaps their quality has improved in recent years?).  It lasted about 2 years before i went to sit down and as i did, I heard a loud \"snap\" (i'm not a large or heavy person) and a piece of the frame clearly broke.  The couch cushion in that area immediately started sagging.  Luckily it was under warranty.  I called and the company sent out a rep to examine the couch. He didn't even flip the piece over to feel the obviously broken piece of wood frame poking through the bottom (which i later found to be cheap particle board and not suitable for furniture). He told me it was sagging because i always sat in that same spot and it wore this way over time, which is absolutely not true.  (And even if it was true, a couch is meant to be sat upon and for $4,000, it should last more than a couple of years).  So the 5 year warranty was totally useless.  I got a quote to have it repaired and it was actually cheaper just to buy a new couch.  This may not be Dania's fault, but they should sell better quality furniture for the prices they charge--or stand behind them.  I loved this couch, while it lasted.  Buyer beware.","date":"2017-02-09 07:09:08"}

Here's why.  \n\nAs of now it is just a tasting room that isn't yet licensed to sell pints.  So the good news is the tasting samples are free.  \nHowever, the place isn't anywhere near fully setup and the layout is exceptionally boring.  They have 15-20 plus tap handles installed but only 4 beers on tap.  All 4 beers are IPA's.  All of their IPA's are traditional American IPA's (not west coast style at all).  IE:  No late addition hop flavors or dry hopping. They have three unique IPA's and one IPA that is a blend of the 3 other IPA's.  Boom Sauce was decent.  I'll give them credit on that.  The others where almost average, and one out right sucked.  My worst home brewed IPA tasted better than Consolation Prize.  The two guys working there where cool and very polite however, their knowledge of what's going on at this brewery was fairly minimal. They couldn't tell me the IBU's, a single hop variety used, or even how many barrel system they are using.  I talked to other locals at various breweries and they expressed disdain for the owner calling him some rich guy, and I quote \"a trust fund baby that knows nothing about beer\".  I have not met the owner so I will not express my personal opinion, however these are quotes from locals at a brewery in Chelsea.  I'm not going to knock the place for it's in the middle of no where location since I can see this becoming a very cool place some day with the right style and architectural design ideas.  If you create a cool layout that incorporates outside seating, glass walls, large wood beams, stainless, and art this place could be very cool.  Even if they don't do anything and make it a simple tap room without food it could still bring in the people.  You guys need variety.  Going all in on 1 IPA is a recipe for disaster.

Beers are cheap, food is pretty good and if you're one of those people that feels better knowing that the food came from local sources (I'm not), you'll enjoy dining here. Not super busy on a weekend night, but not empty either. I had some good crabcakes, and one of the better turkey burgers I've ever had. I am reluctant to say the best turkey burger because the restaurant advertised it as such on their menu and I don't want to validate their cockiness. \nRafiki loses a star here for an intrusive, but probably well-intentioned, intervention. My gf got a salad that had radicchio in it and was mentioning to me a very normal volume that the salad was mediocre when I asked how it was. The manager, who was apparently eavesdropping on our conversation, proceeded to come over to the table and tell us that he couldn't help but overhear that she didn't like the salad. He explained that radicchio is a \"acquired taste\", then came back a second time when we were done with this course and accused my girlfriend of just pushing it around her plate and not eating it. He offered to take it off the bill, which was a nice gesture, though it wasn't the restaurant's fault that we didn't like radicchio and chose poorly. Anyway, it was a bit too intrusive and my gf was worried about what she said for the rest of dinner lest the manager come back and say he overheard something about the food.","date":"2011-07-28 14:24:19"}

It was a Sunday afternoon and the place was bustling. The wait for a table was about 15 minutes because it was a lunch rush. I was tired, hungry, and getting grumpy because I needed to feed! I was thinking to myself that this place better be good. And because of this wait, I was going to be even more critical of their food than I already am. \n\nWe finally got seated and after looking through their big menu, I decided on the meat loaf. Now meat loaf is something that's either REALLY good or REALLY bad. There is no in-between. I took the chance and ordered it. The food came out fast considering how busy the place was. Suprisingly, the meat loaf was good! Actually, it was great! I couldn't believe my mouth because I've never tasted a meat loaf equivalent to my mom's meat loaf, yet here I was eating something that compares to it. It was that good. \n\nSince moving here, I've eaten at Black Bear a few more times, trying different items from the menu. Their breakfast menu is my favorite. I get the meat lovers omelette with hash and pancakes. It's always as expected, and always fililng. They serve very large portions. \n\nBlack Bear Diner is your typical \"All American\" diner. It has everything from breakfast to dessert so you'll always find something to feed your hunger. The place is clean, prices fair, and service is good.

They taught us about every aspect of the brewing process, how to taste and observe beer, and the technology of the glass that Sam Adams has invented. The tasting was amazing.

I'm not looking for standard kabobs and hummus when I step into a truly Turkish eatery. \n\nTwo of us decided to do a bit of a tasting menu and to-go any leftovers giving us the opportunity to try as many dishes as we could. Ordered the following:\n\nMandolin Pinot - 2015\nDip Trio - Hummus\/Hipiti\/Tzakiki\nFalafel \nKasseri Kofte\nZataa'r Pide\nSide of Soujouk Pastrami\nLamb kebab with bulgar\nSomon\nKunefe\n\nFirst off the service from Imran and hostess was great after a bit of a hiccup. The Mandolin Pinot was well recommended. \n\nIt was great to see they had Hipiti on the menu and it was terrific as was the hummus in the trio. The tzakiki was good but pretty standard and bit acidic. The falafel were seasoned well but were way too dry internally. \n\nThe Kasseri Kofte was spot on. The lamb meat was good quality and flavor of the Kasseri Cheese was similar to how it tasted when I tried it in Istanbul. To parallel this dish to an American dish, picture a Minnesota style Juicy Lucy burger with lamb instead of beef and Kasseri instead of Cheddar...BOOM!!\n\nI was also glad to see Pide's on the menu and was hopeful they weren't bland and generic like most of the Pide's I've had in the States.\nI'd say it was better than average. Next time I'm going to try the standard Lahmacun Pide. The Soujouk Pastrami they had was also really authentic and will maybe try that Pide as well at some point.\n\nThe Lamb kebab was ordered medium but cooked medium well. The flavor was quite good and the meat was pretty tender for the level of doneness. The bulgar that accompanied this dish was surprisingly good as well. The Somon (Salmon) was pretty great as well and the portion size was more than generous. It was slightly overdone but my gf ordered it medium well. \n\nTo end this beast of a meal we ordered the Kunefe which was one of the main reasons I wanted to try this place. I used to cook this dish up with my Turkish friends in college and then got to try all their mother's\/grandmother's renditions in Turkey. I have a pretty good idea of what a good Kunefe should taste like and this might have been the most authentic dishes they have. It was definitely the best I've had outside of Turkey. I recommend getting this every time.\n\nOverall, there were a lot of things I liked about this place and a few things I didn't. I look forward to coming back here and trying some of the other authentic offerings.","date":"2018-01-21 05:43:41"}

Gallo Nero now has a full liquor license and an expanded menu that came along with the renovations, both pluses. Our waitress was super friendly and helped to make our dining experience positive. Initially, we were served dinner rolls which were toasted and nothing too special, except the house made garlic olive oil they serve with the bread is so delicious, you want to keep eating more and more! I started with the homemade chicken lemon rice soup ($2.50) which was nice and hearty, containing lots of rice and white meat chicken. There was a subtle lemon flavor, but not overpowering. It was very enjoyable on this cold night! For our meal, we ordered the Classsico Pizza ($10.79), which was a delicious pizza topped with a sweet tomato sauce, romano and mozzarella cheese. The crust was doughy and the cheese was gooey...the perfect way to eat a pizza. We also ordered the Roasted Eggplant Ravioli Alla Margarita ($13.29) which came with a salad of our choice. We ordered the Caesar salad which was your typical Caesar salad with romaine, parmesan and croutons and a nice creamy dressing. The ravioli was served to us steaming hot, fresh out of the kitchen! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the filling was a flavorful eggplant and cheese mixture, smothered in a sweet tomato sauce with melted balls of fresh mozzarella. It almost tasted like a lightened up eggplant parmesan in a way, with the eggplant, cheese and sauce- without the fried part. It was very enjoyable. The waitress was able to sell us on the cannoli for dessert as soon as she told us the filling is homemade. Again, another delicious item here at Gallo Nero. We were pleasantly stuffed, and will definitely be back!","date":"2016-01-30 02:47:53"}

In fact, we had called earlier that evening to confirm our 9:30pm Open Table reservation and was told they had an 8:30pm reservation available if we wanted it. We snapped it up!\n\nDespite the bad weather, we arrived on time at 8:30pm. We knew something wasn't right when we saw about a dozen people in coats clustered around the front door. We checked in with the two frazzled hostesses who noted that they were running about 30 minutes behind \"due to weather.\" They suggested we get a drink at the bar but alas that area was completely filled with people both sitting and standing. We opted to wait.\n\nAnd wait we did. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we noticed three tables open up. There were still about 12 of us (6 couples) crammed together by the front door waiting to be seated. Those 3 tables remained empty for the next twenty minutes. My husband suggested that maybe they were trying to give the kitchen a chance to catch up. My response was that even if that were the case, why not sit three couples and offer them a drink or just some bread?\n\nAs we waited for our table, we could not help but notice that the two hostesses seemed completely overwhelmed... but were not seating anyone. They spent a lot of time on the phone and rearranging menus. They also seemed preoccupied with chasing departing female patrons out the door and handing out complimentary roses rather than working their way through the reservation list. \n\nAfter 50 minutes of waiting, and twenty minutes of eyeing the three empty tables. we watched the hostesses seat a couple who had arrived 10 minutes after us. I approached the hostesses, asked how long the wait would be given that we were approaching 60 minutes and was promptly seated at one of the longstanding empty tables. Another couple who had arrived at the same time as my husband and I then also approached the hostesses and were seated immediately. It made us wonder why we made a reservation at all? (I also received an email from Open Table today indicating that the Blue Ox reported that we never showed up for our reservation. So I have to ask: what exactly were the hostesses doing all night besides handing out roses?)\n\nDespite it being obvious that there was a 50-60 minute wait to be seated despite having a reservation, none of the restaurant patrons got even an apology from the manager. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I can tell you that this is common policy when dealing with such an obvious customer service issue. (It also helps to offer a complimentary cocktail or appetizer to acknowledge the rough start. Nope, nothing of the sort.) Just a harried waitress who I felt genuinely sorry for because she seemed completely in the weeds. \n\nFood was quite good but service was - not unexpectedly - very slow. We skipped dessert because by the time we finished our entrees (served at 10:30pm), it was almost 11pm. Of course we tipped well... Not the fault of the server that all of this was happening. \n\nWhat a disappointment. Normally I would give fewer stars for such a bad experience but we ate here before (spring 2014) and it was delightful. So three stars to reflect one nice experience and one disaster. Not sure we will go back, though.","date":"2015-02-16 06:09:33"}

I spoke with two nurses on the phone, Steve and Jackie, prior to bringing my husband to Oviedo Centra Care. Both nurses were terrific, answered my questions, and once there, Jackie, who was on duty, was just as caring in person as she was over the phone. The doctor, John Feenburg, an osteopath, had a very pleasant demeanor and zeroed in on the problem right away. He did not 'talk down' to either of us, and more importantly, he immediately honed in on the most probable reason for my husband's recurrent fever. He prescribed the appropriate medication for the problem and gave us a print out detailing his verbal instructions.\n\n As an aside, I have found from past experience that osteopaths are very good diagnosticians. As an example, Dr. Feenburg did a urinalysis, but he also ordered a culture with sensitivity test. (to see which antibiotics the bacteria would be most suspectible to and those it would be resistant to).  Results for this test are usually received in 5-7 days after it is ordered. Because of the thorough nature of the tests that Dr. Feenburg ordered, it was discovered that the antibiotic needed to be changed when the results of the culture came back. In addition, Carol called me immediately with the results and faxed them to our home (after we signed the appropriate release and faxed it to them) so that we could take a copy to my husband's wonderful urologist, who then made the appropriate change in the medication. \n\nDr. Feenburg is to be commended for his attention to detail, which often times, can mean the difference between getting to the crux of the medical issue and just putting a 'bandaid' on it. We are so grateful to both Drs. Feenburg and Gundian  (my husband's urologist) for their consistently stellar care and diagnostics. I am very pleased with this facility, I highly recommend them, and I would not hesitate to use them in the future should the need arise.","date":"2010-03-13 02:16:07"}

It was ok, but we both preferred the chile verde.\n\nHad a Palomimosa. Mmm, let's say I didn't finish it. \n\nNow the part that didn't sit well was the chilaquiles had nearly half a whole egg shell in the poached egg Bc my husband kept spitting out egg shells until he finally said something. (He's ridiculously patient.) he wanted to leave.\n\nso I waited for our server who didn't come by for awhile and had to flag down someone else who got the manager. They of course apologized and remade the dish. It was out within 5 min and he finished the second in little time and no trouble.\n\nThe server we had- let's say- we can only assume she was probably having a bad day. She was the least happy person on the floor. Never smiled, was semi-attentive, made helpful suggestions but always curt, and seemed more annoyed w us after we spoke to the manager who came by to address the dish. Every other server and host seemed to love being there and had fun. Ours- not so much. \n\nThey comped the dish without saying, which was nice. However, I'm not sure if it's worth the hype. If we had waited 1.5 hours (like everyone else has been) and had this happen to us~ we def would've rated the experience a 1 star. \n\nWould I go back? Not sure. Is it worth the wait? Also not sure. However, if u can go and not wait, it's a fun brunch experience w interesting choices.","date":"2016-07-03 20:32:38"}

A few nights back a hiring mixer for a company that I applied for was being hosted at Sherlocks.  It was a nice treat to see this place in such a glum run of the mill shopping plaza, although weird at first.  Plus the sign and lights for this store are pretty rad.  It plays on the movie and Hollywood theme of the name.\n\nThey have a ton of variety!  Anything from clothing, shoes, hats and hand bags from all eras, but they have vintage posters and magazines.  The owner is a lovely young woman that works along side her sister and collects merchandise for the store.  Some of the items are eclectics but many vintage lovers collect the odd.\n\nThe store itself is bigger than expected for a vintage store.  It was also a little unkempt, due to inventory and merchandising.  But these things should be taken care of prior to store hours not during business.  It made the place look really messy.  Also, if the owner ever reads this the gang of 30 something year-old guys hanging outside the store was a little weird.  The dog was cute but it made me a little uncomfortable to want to try on clothes knowing that a group of guys were outside and the store owner was running all over the place.","date":"2010-11-23 20:10:25"}

There were many flies flying around the seats also.  I then decided that it wasn't worth the wait anymore and I left.

A love (Maria) to call my own! I found out about Bradley & Diegel through Gilt City and bought one of their specials to get a hair cut. I procrastinated for so long that instead of getting a pre-birthday haircut as I intended, I got a \"God help me, I'm starting to look like Medusa!!!\" haircut. \n\nMy appointment was set with Maria and from the consultation, I knew she was going to be outstanding. I plopped down in her chair, lifted a lank lock of my overgrown hair, and told her that I just celebrated my 30th birthday (*sob*) and wanted a change from the long hair that I've been sporting for the last 6 years. I just wanted something fresh and contemporary that wouldn't be a huge hassle. Maria suggested an a-line cut with the shortest pieces still at the base of my neck, so I went for it.\n\nI was led to what I think was the world's most perfect shampoo chair which was all Star Trek-like and mechanized....and gave a pretty good massage, too! The shampoo assistant (Gabe?) had great hands and I felt myself relaxing under his head massage. \n\nNormally I'm not a chatty salon person. I will bring a book and read and don't want to make small talk. However, Maria and I talked almost the entire time while she was cutting and blowdrying and flat-ironing and not once did I regret our conversation. She is so funny and spunky and cute.

The usual slow pace of a winter afternoon in Medford becomes a scurry of cashiers, customers and cold cuts. Pasta, patrons and provolone. Slicers, Sicilians and spare change. Fettucini, fa... you get it.\n\nSeriously, though. A deceptively bright and clean shop with three floor to ceiling shelves of imported Italian goods, surrounded by an L-shaped deli, butcher and fry station. Fry station? Isstrue, babaloo. In addition to the usual suspects on their sandwich board, Bob's throws a Greek diner twist by adding steak fries made to order in basket fryers. Somewhat out of place, yet not entirely undesirable, adding an unique nuance to the amalgam of airborne flavors I could easily become addicted to.\n\nMy Italian deli combo ($6 small, $7 jumbo) stacked a trio of cold cuts - salame, mortadella, soppresatta - on soft, chewy scali. I asked for the works sans onion, resulting in romaine lettuce, slightly firm tomatoes and thick slices of cherry peppers instead of traditional giardiniera. Salt, pepper and a splash of dressing to taste and we were off to the races.\n\nLesson 1: Get a small.\n- Why? It's fucking big. Sure, the large is 50c more and the jumbo is only a $1 extra. But you're not a cow with two empty stomachs. Get a small.\n\nLesson 2: Know what toppings you'd like\n- Nothing comes standard on the sub, but you can get it with anything they have behind the counter. \"Yeah, could you top that proscuitto with marinated mozzarella, sliced Jordan's almonds and a splash of Italian wedding soup? Thanks boss.\"\n\nLesson 3: Stand in one place.\n- The frenetic motion of call-in customers picking up orders slung by three or four guys behind the counter can easily make you a human pinball. Pick a spot, hunker down and mind your drool.\n\nBob's will easily become a favorite, as it is to many a Medford resident and neighboring employees the staff addressed by name. A small but powerful and well-oiled machine, cranking out colorful, sumptuous sandwiches for pocket change. I will return and soon, knowing Dave's Fresh will understand - Bob's is that remarkable.","date":"2011-01-08 23:27:14"}

Finally, after 5 minutes, the greedy server came around to take our drink order, some of us order iced water, some coke, and sprite, and my son order a lemonade, which after 3 minutes, she told us they where out of.  She offered him either a coke or sprite, which he rejected, and asked instead for a glass with iced water.  After 5 minutes, SURPRISE, he had a lemonade on the table, or at least looked as one, but no it was a flavorless glass of water with lots of sugar in it. Now, going to the food, dumplings were delicious, eggroll tasted like frozen food boxed one, sweet and sour pork was crappy, crispy beef was great, walnut shrimp was ok, about a B+, chowmein and fried rice were lousy, flavorless and warm, not hot as they should.  When the check came, I don't understand why they impose you a 18-20% tip already included on your bill.

Tips are deserved with the quality of your service: terrible service = no tip, bad service = no more than 10%, ok service = upto 15%, great service = 18% up to no limit.

I recently moved to Austin from Seattle and was afraid I wouldn't be able to find a place that could replicate my beloved Stumptown and Caffe Vita, but Medici does, right down to the atmosphere. The lattes and cappuccinos are always done to perfection (perfect texture on the steamed milk) and the toddys and iced tea are refreshing on a warm day. As a plus, there are good quality pastries and breakfast tacos available in the morning, as delicious as you would find at a run of the mill bakery. If you get there earlier in the morning - between 7 and 9 - you'll usually be able to find a good seat with a laptop plugin, but outside of then it gets crowded, although the noise level is always reasonable. My only complaint with the place is that it's too cool for school and you might be embarrassed asking for skim milk or something froofy. However, all of the baristas are friendly, if quite hipster. Go to Medici and get your fix! Only place I like as well is JP's.\n\nP.S. Don't be discouraged by the price, all the coffee here is expensive.","date":"2012-03-01 00:35:07"}

We even had Beau Thai cater my sons graduation party - and the party guests raved about the food.\n\nThe food itself can sometimes be standard thai food, but there are two key standouts that we personally must get here: \n1. The crab puffs on the appetizers menu. Almost every other thai restaurant has these, but the difference here is that these are not flat wontons that have a tiny bit of stuffing inside them. These are genuine PUFFS and are very full. When I order these at other restaurants, I'm always disappointed by the amount of fried empty wonton I have to tear away so that I can get a bite with some stuffing in it. Why would I want to eat just straight fried wonton wrapper? Pointless. Beau Thai makes these a really wonderful way - they are full, they are delicious, not too crabby tasting-but clearly made with crab, and (I'm pretty sure) you get 8 to an order. It's a great deal for the price.  They also have peas in them, which I find delightful, my non-pea-loving son does not. I like the added flavor and the little bit of texture it brings. They aren't overwhelming so even though my son doesn't like peas, he still LOVES these crab puffs.\n\n2. Peanut chicken. I don't actually know if that's even the name, but that's what we've been calling it for almost a decade. Regardless of what you call it, t's REALLY good stuff. It's this huge bowl full of chicken swimming in peanut sauce. It's almost a soup, but served over rice and oh-so-good. There's nobody in Portland that serves this in the same way (that we have ever heard of). We almost always order a separate dish of this to go home with us - it's even better the next day (I like it served in a wrap with lettuce- mmmmm!). \n\n**the chicken satay is also a favorite, but it's really just chicken and peanut sauce (see number 2 above). \n\nThe service here can NOT be beat. We just adore the owner and her staff. If you call the order in, it will be ready quickly, and if you're in a hurry but eating there-just let her know and she will get your food to you in a flash. If you don't special request the speedy service, it's pretty normal wait time if you have a group-almost no wait time if there's just two of you, but you can definitely tell that the food is made fresh. \n\nThe restaurant itself is wonderful. Great atmosphere, always very clean, good location, lots of seating. My friends and I love that they have these massive booths for groups, I think they probably fit 8-10 easily and have some wonderful privacy to them. Every time I'm there with a group, we feel like we're in a private room.\n\nParking is the only issue. If you don't mind walking, just head down a couple blocks to 18th or so and you'll find lots. Parking on 21st is always a mess though and isn't a blight on the restaurant itself.\n\nI highly recommend Beau Thai - locally owned,  authentic thai owner, perfect ambience, and wonderful food at reasonable prices all make for a great experience.","date":"2013-09-04 02:10:04"}

The beginning was a bit bumpy, I'll admit. It was a bit of a challenge to get that first appointment scheduled. Phone tag, having to schedule a number of weeks out, that sort of thing. \n\nThe good news is--the cleaners are great! I've had all 3 cleanings at this point, each time different women, and in each case, I've been happy with the results. They are both efficient and thorough. And more good news--once you're a client, the communication with Ann Marie seems to get easier. For example, one time the women arrived 45 mins late (I doubt it was their fault), so I had to reschedule. A quick text message was all it took, and they were scheduled to come back a few days later. \n\nI've based my rating on my ongoing experience with communication, scheduling and the quality of the work rather than on the initial communication. I'm starting to understand that, more often than not, whether it be housecleaning, spa treatment or mani pedis, the booking of a service that I buy from Groupon et al is probably not going to be that satisfying.

I have been to aquariums around the world, Corpus Christi, Heraklion, Melbourne, and half a dozen others. \n\nWhenever we travel we usually check out the city's aquarium. Most are not that great.\n\nThis one is designed very well, the signage and descriptions are nice, there's lots of space and there is a huge variety here. \n\nI've been 3 times in the past year, so I used my annual membership enough. It's really cool being able to see beluga whales out here. \n\nThe sea otter is a riot as well too. He makes the funniest faces when he's meticulously scrubbing his face and mouth. Kids will love him. \n\nMy only complaint is that I don't really like that they show plates of fish or sushi next to tanks of fish. I find it disturbing that children are being shown animals in captivity and then oh by the way this is how we eat them after. Kids have an affection for animals and sea creatures I don't think you need to keep telling them that btw they're on the lunch menu too. \n\nAlso the dolphin trainers go on and on about how you can help the dolphins too as long as you look for ocean wise fish to eat at your local restaurant.  What about being vegetarian? Or even vegan? That helps the fish AND the dolphins from being trapped and the oceans from being over fished.  Of course not everyone wants to live like this, but there are other options to helping dolphins than just buying ocean wise fish once in a while. Never eating fish makes a big impact too. \n\nI wish this place was more vegetarian (especially vegan) friendly, just because so many of us love animals and don't want to eat them as well. There are only a scant few options at the on site \"cafe\" that we just don't bother and eat before. \n\nAside from this, it's a really nice aquarium. It's best to go on weekdays.

A few months ago they hired a couple of new guys for that shift, and since then the service at breakfast has declined sharply. \n\nThe guy who used to run the counter at breakfast was cheerful, courteous, and FAST. There were plenty of all the different types of tacos wrapped and ready to go, and I could grab my coffee, choose my tacos, pay and leave in less than five minutes, usually just as long as it took me to fix my coffee and take out my wallet.\n\nThe first time I went since that guy left, there were two new guys, one running the counter and the other preparing the tacos. Both of the kinds I usually get weren't ready, and the taco prepper took a while to make the tacos, then set the bag down on the counter without letting the guy manning the register know that they were ready. I stood there for several minutes until the cashier noticed the bag sitting there, even after I told him they were ready and had been set down. \n\nThe last time I went there, there was only one customer ahead of me in line, who looked tense and irate, waiting for the same \"taco prepper\" guy from the previous time to fix his tacos (he usually wears a bandana on his head). This time he was also running the register. I got my coffee, waited in line while the gentleman ahead of me finally got his food and paid.\n\nThe guy came and took my order, started chatting me up while he sloooowly made my tacos. Then he asked me if I was okay (I guess it showed on my face that I was annoyed), and I told him I was just in a rush. Then he loudly said that they're never in a rush at Live Oak Market, and I told him that they used to be, and that I used to be able to get my order quickly. He told me to have a nice day, and I left. \n\nI've worked in customer service for years, including working as a barista at a busy coffee shop, and I find the notion that \"rushing\" during what is known as \"rush hour\" on a weekday morning to be perfectly acceptable. The primary reason people stop there is because, yes, the tacos are good and so is the coffee, supporting local businesses is important, AND because you can jump out of your car, grab your food and coffee, and get back on the road in five minutes or less (or you should be able to, rather). If you're not prepared to \"rush\" between the hours of 7 and 9 a.m. on a weekday, and you're serving breakfast and coffee, then you're in the wrong business.\n\nLuckily, a family owned taco truck opened directly across the street from Live Oak Market in the old Valero parking lot. Their tacos are less expensive, taste much better, the staff is friendly, and they're always ready when you get there. So, no more Live Oak for me in the mornings. I make my own coffee and get tacos across the street. \n\n(During the rest of the day, the staff is great, and I still love the store in general, but I hope they replace their early morning staff.)","date":"2014-07-28 01:39:58"}

It's on the left traveling South and is due West from Atlantic Station, as the crow flies. Parking is limited but free - try to visit during slightly off-hours to ensure a space. The interior is modernist with plenty of shiny white surfaces and glass. There's a nice deck out front where you can watch all the idiots get backed-up in the crappy traffic - they like it when you yell at them for no reason, but forego throwing any items at the cars - they don't like that and may pull-over to find out \"what's your problem\"... \n\nI've now visited this location a few times and I feel that it's the best of the three.I was a bit dismayed at the Buckhead location (mediocre, over-priced food and lackluster service) but the now defunct Highland location and this one have more than made up for my initial opinion. This is one of those \"fine dining\" attempts at burgers but don't be put-off - there are a few tricks to ordering that make Flip worthwhile. First, instead of picking one of the signature burgers, go with the sliders - it provides up to three different flavor combinations to keep things interesting. Second, have a cocktail or beer with dinner but leave some room for the delicious milkshakes - I recommend the Marshmallow Nutella unless you're not into that flavor - then go with the Krispy Kreme Donut - both live up to their respective labels.\n\nFor a cocktail, try the Southern Gent - it's an interesting fusion of sweet whiskey sour and will remind you of a sweet tea. To get stared, try the pork-belly-on-a-stick with Coca-Cola ketchup and pop-rocks or the smoked brisket empanadas - this latter is quite good.\n\nFor those sliders, try the Butcher's Cut and a Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich if they are available (the menu seems to change, or at least has changed during my last two visits) and don't forget the sweet potato tots. Or if you're really feeling it, order the trio of tots, rings and fries - very filling and all quite good as sides.

Anywayyyyy...\n\nThis place is a thrift \/ vintage clothing store. You can find some pretty good things to wear for pretty cheap. You are gonna find shorts, pants, shirts in the 5-20 dollar range. The major bonus with this place is that they only accept interesting clothing when they resale, so chances are you are going to find something unique that no one else has around here.\n\nYou can resell your clothes to this place. Usually the line for this is pretty long and they don't give you much for what you trade in so I wouldn't recommend this whole thing unless you have a half day to blow for fun.\n\nParking for this place is horrible. Period.\n\nBottom line - I highly recommend adding this store to your rolodex ( if they still make those anymore..  ) Just add this place to your mental list of places to shop at when you need new clothes.. come 'on.... do it.. you know you want to.. ;D","date":"2010-07-07 23:01:10"}

I'm rounding this up from a 3.5 review because I feel like this place deserves a second chance due to the fact that I might have just been overly picky about my particular dish. \n\nI ordered the sweet potato hash with black tea. The hash was absolutely delicious BUT it was (1) way too oily (2) the eggs were NOT \"poached\" as indicated by the menu, but instead fried over easy. Due to the hash being way too greasy for my liking, I think I might just stick with the salads, smoothies, tea, and coffee the next time I come by. \n\nI did like the atmosphere, beverages, and general diversity of the menu very much so I will be coming back to try everything out again.","date":"2015-06-21 03:22:58"}

Sure I could pull out my phone but I'm LAZY. Plus I would've liked to see some spotlights or some kind of write ups of the farms.

I've been to my share of museums but this one evoked an inexplicable sense of peace and serenity. We only had about 45 minutes to walk through the entire museum but it was doable; reason being that it's a small, small museum. There are also no usual signs posted next to each and every piece of art and furniture in a room. Instead in the middle of most rooms you will find laminated pages to identify the pieces on each wall -- North Wall, West Wall, etc. There are only 4 floors, but visitors to the museum can only go to 3 since the topmost floor is used for offices. The top floor is also the floor that Mrs. Garden lived. \n\nI was most interested in the first floor though. The first large painting that you see once you enter to your left is so well illuminated and so beautifully painted that it just jumps out at you like a moment in time. The colors are so vivid and the characters in the painting seem to be in motion, it is that mesmerizing. The garden, though it was closed when we were there, looked to be very peaceful and a great place to just forget about time. But the courtyard is what got me. It is amazing. That a place like this would be in Boston. This Venetian inspired architectural masterpiece bringing a moment's peace, a moment's quiet to your life as I'm sure it did many a time its past owner. To top things off this museum is more affordable than others in NY and SF for example -- admission is $12. If you arrive half an hour before close admission's free!\n\nThere are some things that would make this experience better -- if there were actual descriptions, explanations, or something more of all the art pieces in there instead of just names. I would've liked to know why Mrs. Isabella Gardner found such joy and such passion in these artworks compared to others, what these paintings meant historically and currently. Some information posted around about Mrs. Gardner herself would also have been helpful and given a foundation for understanding the mish-mash of artwork and her obsession with chairs. It's hard to imagine someone living like that, in a place that was essentially a museum from the start, but this place is truly amazing.","date":"2009-10-15 02:53:45"}

It's expensive, but I have found myself dining here at this point six times.  In the process I have discovered the following truths about Uchiko:\n\nFirst and foremost, save room for dessert;  this is usually the most clever, imaginative and poetic course of the night.\n\nSecondly, get advice from your server; while I will admit, service has not been entirely consistent in quality, it is often absolutely top notch.  The servers at Uchiko have always been kind, insightful, ultra attentive, and they often make excellent suggestions.\n\nThirdly, do not expect intimacy.  This is one slight criticism I have of Uchiko; although it could be just personal taste, I find it's a little noisy and feels a little intimidating. It's always completely packed with a 20 - 30 something hip crowd which can be noisy, albeit joyful and energetic.\n\nanother slight criticism: occasionally you have to wait a bit for your order to be taken.  It's happened twice to me, but other times not...  I think this makes my point about slight service inconsistencies.\n\nBring a small light, because Uchiko is quite dark!  \n\nTry the stranger dishes... In fact, ask for the most adventuresome dishes!  You will consistently be surprised.  Don't go for the popular ones because, although they are always good, they sometimes lack that special touch which justifies a very high price. It's there in ingredients, but... Just feels a little bit assembly line made.  I took a dear friend here and she was disappointed that she had been charged such a high dollar amount for an ok roll (I'm referring to the roll that's called p- followed by a number.) I think Uchiko and the whole line of restaurants have gotten so popular that occasionally that special touch is missing from some of the popular items on the menu.  GO FOR THE WIERD! \n\nBe kind to the staff and you will have such a wonderful experience.  Seriously, this restaurant has a great amount of heart!  If you go in looking to have an adventure, and make it clear that you are open for that, you will certainly have a great treat!\n\nOnce again, save room for dessert!!!!","date":"2014-11-12 14:05:46"}

We started with an amuse of a lightly smoked salmon crudo and a small butternut squash soup.  I then had foie gras 2 ways (seared and a torchon).  The torchon I think was the better of the 2 preparations although there was a string of connective tissue in it which I found a little unappetizing.  Also I felt that it could have benefited from a couple of crystals of sea salt on the top to give it a little more flavor.  My wife had the organic lettuce salad with fruits and olive oil.  It was well.... a salad nothing bad about it but I would not call it outstanding either.  I had the rack of lamb and my wife had a piece of soy glazed sable fish.  The sable fish had a nice texture.  It was kind of like a cross between cod and sea bass and it had some firmness but not as firm as cod and a slight buttery flavor to it but not as buttery as sea bass either.  I ordered my lamb chops medium rare but they came out a little closer to medium.  For dessert we both had a Grand Marnier souffle.  It's been a VERY long time since I have had a properly done souffle.  They certainly have a good example of the breed here.  Also try the Canadian ice wine here.  It is addictive.  If the torchon and the lamb had been properly executed I'd have given them 4 stars.  At this price point, you have to execute flawlessly with every dish.","date":"2010-08-22 01:08:39"}

Pickles for $5 for goodness sake.\n\nGot a golf ball size scoop of chopped liver for $5. They do have a serious problem with quantity here.\n\nThe food itself is pretty good.  I will say the little matzoh ball was the right consistency and had nice flavor (you get two with the bowl) and the meat knish had a great crust and filling.  The chopped liver needed more texture, crunch of onion and a little more schmaltz.  My grandmother would have agreed, I am sure.

We were enjoying a little \"staycation\" and had checked into the W hotel for the night. After a relaxing afternoon of massages at Bliss we made a reservation for 10:00 at Maggiano's up the block.  When we arrived it was bustling with Christmas parties, Birthday celebrations, and groups groups groups.  Definitely not the most romantic couples setting, but we were fine and welcomed the energy and fun company.  However the service was pretty abysmal. \n\nWe checked in right on time for our reservation and the host told us it would be a short wait. We asked if we should get a drink at the bar and he said no no no you'll be seated very shortly. So we shifted to the side allowing others to come and go, and we waited...and waited....and waited some more.  After about 10 minutes we shifted about 3 feet to the bar which was not very crowded at all. There we waited....and waited...and waited again although the bartender was not busy at all.  Finally I shouted out my order for a Stella draft and he snapped out of it, brought me my beer, and took my guys' order.  We drank our beers and still, no table?  Eventually after over 25 minutes I went up to the Host again and asked what was up?  He looked perplexed and then realized he had given our table to someone else in error.  You know mistakes happen but we were standing right in front of him and I tried to make eye contact half a dozen times but he never once looked away from his computer screen or from chatting with colleagues. \n\nWe got a brief apology and were finally seated.  Luckily we were in such a good mood we didn't let the past half hour get in our way of a good time.  But here's where the real fun begins.  We were sat in the middle of it all.  Parties all around us but we didn't mind, though my bf had to move his seat every two minutes for waiters to get through as we were apparently sat in their immediate line of traffic.  We did however mind the fact that we had to wait over 10 minutes to order drinks, another ten + to order our entrees, another 15 to receive.  And what was put in front of us was the saltiest food either of us had ever tasted.  I like salty food but my pasta dish was INEDIBLE.  By this time it's after 11, the crowds have thinned out and there are teams cleaning up all around us preparing to close down.  When the waiter came to clear our plates and saw I hadn't eaten my meal he did ask why and after politely telling him it was too salty, he took the pasta off the bill which we did not ask for but we did appreciate it.  \nIn the end we experienced really bad service and were fine with shrugging our shoulders and chalking it up to the busy holiday season, but the fact that our salads, app, and entrees were unimpressive and overly salty really added insult to injury.  The good news?  I was planning on having a heavy Italian feast, but I end consuming very little food, which is much better for my waistline :-)","date":"2013-01-27 23:10:45"}

But probably only if I'm in the mood for something other than a burger.","date":"2015-12-21 00:51:11"}

We were able to book a great summer rate. When we arrived, we'd had a very long day (it's a long story), and upon check-in, without us asking, the cast member, Jossie, who is as sweet as they come, granted us a \"Magical Moment\" by upgrading us from a garden view room to a lagoon view room. The room itself was very nice - modern, comfortable beds, plenty of space, hidden Mickeys galore, and adequate (but not updated) bathroom. But the real benefit of this room was not only the proximity to Magic Kingdom and the monorail, but the amazing view. We were able to see and hear all the activity around us from our balcony - the buses, boats, monorail, Magic Kingdom Railroad, train whistle, and everything else that goes on all day long - while still enjoying the peace and relative seclusion of the resort's location. I had never seen this mentioned in any prior reviews, and feel it's worth pointing out that the Grand Floridian (to my knowledge) is the only deluxe resort that is directly on a body of water (without something else between the hotel and the lake, like a beach or a boardwalk or a parking lot), and I was not expecting the peacefulness that comes with having a room directly on the lake. With all the noise around us - this part of Disney really feels like a small city - I was surprised and calmed by the sound of the waves against the shore, as well as the sounds and sights of the shore birds and other wildlife on the lake. The Grand Floridian has also left many beautiful trees on the shore of the lake between the building and the lake. Some of them do block the view of the castle from the rooms, and that was the case with our room, but I concluded that this is a small price to pay for the ambiance and beauty the trees lend to the resort overall. Even with a tree blocking our direct view to the castle itself, we could still see the Wishes fireworks perfectly.\n\nThe pools and splash park at this resort are fabulous. We enjoyed each of them, and allowed our kids to dictate where we would spend our days. Some days, they wanted to go the shallow pool with the little splash fountains, other days they were all about the splash park with the two small slides and lots of fun water features for little kids, and on others they wanted to swim in the deeper pool (and mom and dad loved the waterslide there, too).\n\nThis hotel has a wide variety of shops and restaurants. On the first floor, there is a sundries shop with basic grocery and some lovely souvenir items, as well as an upscale clothing store filled with Vineyard Vines, Lilly Pulitzer and other similar brands. On the second floor, you'll find a toy store which is great for the kids and has a wide variety of princess dresses (along with lots of other items), and a delicious bath shop called Basin. The main building of the hotel is just a lovely place to spend time - there is an Orchestra playing each afternoon & evening on the 2nd floor, a pianist and sometimes singers at other times - it's a beautiful place to walk around or sit and enjoy the ambiance, whether you are staying at the hotel or not.\n\nAs far as restaurants are concerned, Narcoossee's - while overpriced and quite cold inside - is a favorite and a tradition for our family. The kids absolutely love the Mickey mac 'n cheese there, and I always order the shrimp and grits appetizer for my entree along with whatever salad is in season. We enjoy the Grand Floridian Cafe for a simple but delicious lunch. And the poolside dining is perfect for a very casual lunch or dinner by the pool or lake with a lovely view. This time, since we were staying at the GF, we enjoyed s'mores by the fire as well, and the absolute highlight of our trip was watching the Electrical Water Pageant (9pm) and the nightly Wishes fireworks (10pm) from our balcony in our jammies, and crawling right into bed afterwards. I will always remember these moments, and I know our little ones will, too.\n\nWe have stayed and played at many Deluxe resorts, some of which we also adore, and this absolutely tops them all. It is deserving of its name.","date":"2015-08-30 15:00:49"}

How did we not already have this? And it's only here for a limited time? WHAT?! BAR THE EXISTS!

Solider on into the abandoned looking building that once held Hung Far Low and enter the world of Smash Putt. If you think you know your way around the Mini Golf rodeo - think again. This takes Mini Golf, blind folds it, spins in around, and drops it into a whole new world. You'll crawl under lasers, they'll drill a hole in your ball, you'll sabotage your opponents, you'll scratch and sniff your way to a par 3, and you're still not done yet. \n\nSmash Putt is the brain child of artists. Each hole holds it's own unique bag of tricks to keep you on your toes. I came on a Saturday night and while busy it wasn't overwhelming - although I could see how it could get that way. If you're a stickler for order,  just cool your heals, and enjoy the craziness that is Smash Putt. There is no order or rhyme of reason to the holes, it' just for fun.

I was the only one at our table that liked\/loved it because I love creamy pasta, and they don't like butter, so if you like buttery, rich pastas, get this! The sauce is a little bit chunky\/grainy and it would nice nice if there's a bit more seaweed to flavor and not just garnish, but otherwise absolutely delicious.\n\nOkonomayaki 3\/5: Delicious, generous size portioned, but sauce a bit too thick on top and I couldn't taste any shrimp or pork as advertised on the menu. The dough texture was kind of sticky and mushy--Not sure if it's supposed to be like that but I didn't like that aspect. It was fine and I could see it being a filling but small carb-loaded meal for one, but didn't live up to all the expectations I had after watching skilled chefs make it on TV. If you haven't had it before, skip it here and try it somewhere else, I will too!\n\nOmusoba 3\/5: Perfectly fried and seasoned egg blanket, but the noodles inside taste like greasy Chinese takeout, and ruined the crispy egg exterior. Good overall, but not great.\n\nSashimi Carpaccio 2\/5: 6-7 slivers of sashimi on a bed of shaved radish and garnished with micro kale. Looks cute and fancy but no, a scam for $9.95, and didn't taste super fresh.\n\nRiceless sushi roll thing (forgot the name but picture attached) 3\/5: Medley of little bits of raw fish (sashimi scraps hello) and some cucumber, on top of a bed of radish. Interesting and my first time having raw fish rolls without rice-pretty good flavor, but nothing mind blowing. I honestly really like the shaved radish. \n\nWe really wanted to get the Kobore for some fresh uni and a DEAL but they said they ran out and would substitute uni with eel and we were like never mind. Bummer. \n\nMy friends had a ramen which I didn't touch and it was cheap at $8 for a pretty big bowl and they said comparable to Santouka and stuff around Boston.\n\nAmbiance: Not really that well maintained in terms of cleanliness, which is concerning given that this place serves raw fish. I get that real Izakayas aren't sparkling clean, but I'm still concerned. \n\nOther comments: Valet parking for $5 on a pouring, raining day was so worth. The guy that takes phone calls ( I think he's the owner?) is pretty cool and trendy ( in Puma sneakers lol), and friendly with the customers, but is a bit slow when you make reservation\/confirm details probably because the restaurant is so just make sure to confirm your reservation details. \n\nOverall verdict: Uncertain-I don't think there's anything like this around here and the food was pretty good, but I'm just concerned about freshness here. I'll come back to try the Kobore sushi (and make sure when I make reservation they will have it LOL) and if it turns out unfresh I'll probably just keep coming back to try the cooked foods.","date":"2017-05-26 03:26:30"}

The only place between Austin and Houston so far that does it RIGHT!  Leave the fancy clothes at home and go enjoy a REAL meal here. By far the BEST restaurant we came to on our weekend visit to Austin! Thank you again Cristian!!!! Please come to Houston Mandola!","date":"2018-09-03 02:07:33"}

Bagels with the same menu offered nationwide.  The staff was friendly and very quick and efficient.  The place was empty on a Friday morning from 9-10:30 and I found it rather odd, given that Einsteins is a breakfast place. \n\nMy wife ordered the bagel with Lox, onions, and cream cheese. She said it was pretty good, but it could have used a bit more cream cheese. I ordered the Chicken Panini with artichoke and it was very tasty.  We both ordered a strawberry lemonade and thought it was made to order, but when the attendant handed us our food she mentioned the strawberry lemonade is kept in the cooler section along with the milk, OJ, and cream cheese. \n\nMy wife mentioned the place was rather cold inside, and it felt a tad unwelcoming because of it.  The restroom is a one-bloke-at-a-time type of deal, so if the place is busy, you may have to wait to use the facilities.  \n\nOverall, it was a good experience, but nothing to rant and rave about.  If you're hungry and you're in the area you can stop in for a quick meal that is slightly overpriced.  Don't make a drive just to eat here, though.  It's just not that type of place.","date":"2014-07-13 15:00:30"}

I bought a groupon for a full set of eyelash extensions with 1 fill. I go to my appointment for the full set of lash extensions. I'm right on time for my appointment and I walk up to the glass door, which is locked, but I see the woman (who I assume is going to do my lashes because she's the only one in the small room) and she is on her cell phone. She notices me when I walk up to the glass door by looking in the mirror and seeing my reflection. She continues to talk on her phone and hasn't turned around yet to face me. I knock and she still doesn't run around, but I know she's already seen me through the mirror she's staring into. I was thinking \"what's going on here??\" Then after about 20 seconds of me staring at her and her back turned toward me, she finally turns around and points to the chair sitting outside the glass door and when I look down I see that it has papers to fill out for first time customers. I sat down in the chair (mind you she's still on the phone and hasn't unlocked the glass door) and fill out the paper, probably taking about 2 minutes to fill out. I stand up and face the glass door and she's still on the phone, I'm standing there laughing at this point because I can't believe this is going on. Then I had to pee, so I just walked away from the glass door and went to the bathroom (this place is set up inside a building with other clinics\/salons). I go to the bathroom, walk back to he glass door and she's now what it looks like saying goodbye on the phone and then unlocks the door to let me in and says \"sorry\". I was so mad, but didn't say anything and went on with the lash appointment. I've gotten lashes done before so I knew what to expect. Basically the outcome was mediocre (I wanted monger and told her, but they were average length) and my left eye was red and hurting for 2 days afterwards which has never happened before with pervious lash extensions from other places.

The steaks were cooked to our liking and our server asked that we cut into them to confirm before he left them. Both of our dinners came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The potatoes were good but nothing special. The broccoli however is the reason for only giving 4 stars. Broccoli should be steamed and come crisp and bright green in color to the table instead ours looked like what you would expect from Denny's, brown to grey in color and any chef with any self respect would have thrown those in the trash for a restaurant of this level.\nWe had the pineapple upside down cake for desert which comes warm and topped with vanilla ice cream.

Im not from the area, and my GF whos from there, gassed this place up to be something special. Went on a Friday night recently, around 8. Some lady who worked there helped us find a spot in their lot, which was a nice touch, as parking in SoBo is beyond attrocious, cars might as well be banned from parking within the city limits. We sat near the bar area...Hella loud in there, sounded like some obnoxious souls were in the vicinity. Yelling and hollering and such,I mean i get it its a a bar but it was only around 8.

I was gunna opt for the prime rib, they were out of it at the time. No biggie I had a lobster pie in the on deck circle...So I got it, really rubbery and quite bland. The portion wasnt that great either. Not sure why I got fries with it, but I did. The fries were ok, oversalted thought. We waited another 15m after we were done for the check. When the check came, my GF and I split the bill...For the food and service we got, this place is overpriced...I heard the quality took a dive after they remodeled it, from my GF whos been going there for a while.

His replies were very unprofessional, belittling of the reviewer, yet entertaining, due to the fact  I couldn't believe someone who represents the establishment would write such things. I read all the poor reviews to see him go to the point of attacking the patron and accusing them of being at fault for their poor service, never seen anything like it.

I had the Red Curry, Spring Rolls & Egg Rolls. My wife and I enjoyed them thoroughly.\n\nWhat I did not like about the experience, was the lack of flexibility on the part of the counter staff. \n\nMy wife and I are from Canada, we like to experiment with new restaurant experiences by using Groupons. Because we are from Canada, it costs us a small fortune for roaming data services on our cell phone. We buy our groupons, and save an image of the groupon, including the SKU\/Bar Code so it can be documented by the restaurant. We have presented the image to dozens of different restaurants and the staff simply wrote down the Groupon Coupon # and proceeded with the transaction .. but NOT Trai Mai Thai .. the staff refused to allow me to use my groupon unless they could touch the screen on my smartphone to mark the coupon as \"Redeemed\", I explained other restaurants do not have a problem simply taking the number .. but they refused to do so. As a result, I had to delete the Groupon APP from my wife's phone (she has a limited data plan), reload the APP, sign in using my account (Groupon APP does not allow multiple accts), bring up the coupon so the counter staff could touch the \"Redeem\" Icon, then delete the APP, reload the APP and restore my wife's Groupon Acct. Had I known this restaurant did not have the flexibility to deal with a Groupon by writing down the Coupon #, I would have never purchased the Groupon or visited this restaurant. But, the food was great ... creates quite a dilemma, great food .. but lousy customer service!\n\nI would rate the food as 5 Star, but given the customer service and lack of flexibility in accepting a Groupon, even though I explained our unique cell phone\/data issues .. the staff could not have cared less, so overall a 3 Star is suitable.\n\nMore good news though, management quickly responded, confirmed that staff should have simply wrote down the Groupon # and new staff have been brought up to date on the procedure.","date":"2015-03-05 00:31:01"}

Harvard Square isn't exactly full of fine dining options, and although I really enjoy Chipotle and Subway, sometimes you want a grilled ribeye with a truffle and potato puree with sauteed white and green asparagus topped with English pea greens and shaved summer truffle. I got that special for $38 and it was fantastic. The truffle smell and taste were exceptionally strong and the steak was a perfect medium rare. I also got the almond mocha torte for dessert which was very tasty and just the kind of light cake I enjoy.

He told me how he wants to be a 5 star business and that satisfaction is supposed to be 100% guaranteed. And what he could do to make this review a better.\nI gave him my phone number and email as the yelp app for iphone doesn't let you see messages. I got a call on August 6th by Lisa who I can't remember is a co owner or a manager. She explained to me that the arrangement my mom had ordered came in a bud vase so it may have just looked small and what could she do to help. Luckily she was able to find the transaction and upgraded to the next size. It was delivered on the 8th or 9th and was beautiful as said my gma.\n\nA few reasons why this isn't upgraded to a 5 star:\n\n1) The woman I got who answered before Lisa was named Mary. She was sort of rude and snooty. Not very professional even after I explained that I wrote a bad review and the owner was trying to contact me.\n\n2) After I talked to my mom I realized she did a phone order. When she chose the cheapest arrangement it was not detailed as to how it would come. My mom expected something like the mug my gma got the second time around. Not a small bud vase. I believe detailed communication is key for a satisfied customer and consumer when placing a phone order.\n\n3) I got a phone call on the day of delievery questioning if my gma was home. She is in a walker and hard of hearing. I asked Mary if he rang the doorbell and she said yes. After I called my gma and called back Mary she had said he left it with the neighbor. Umm Hello...how do you know the neighbor \n      A) will give it to my gma\n      B) keep it  and pretend nothing was delivered\n  I know the delivery guy did not ring the doorbell.

Me and my husband have been here several times because we love love love their rotisserie chicken meal. Upon sitting down we looked at the menu but we already knew what we were going to have. If you've been to Luke's you know that they have an open concept restaurant. Our server came over and took our order but upon looking around we saw that all the servers including our server, were seated at a long table on the floor eating what I suppose is their lunch. I use to work as a server and it has never been acceptable to eat in front of guest especially if they do not have their food yet. There were about 8 servers seated just eating. We got our food pretty quickly and were very excited to start eating since we love this dish so much. Unfortunately it did not taste as it normally has in the past which is AMAZING! We still ate everything but when our server came around and asked how was everything my husband asked if they had possibly changed the chicken recipe? Because it just didn't taste as it did all the other times we came. She explained that the recipe was still the same so we said ok no big deal. I saw her approach the manager on the floor to tell him about our question on the chicken recipe. He looked at me while she was talking because our server pointed to our table and he rolled his eyes like he did not want to be bothered about the situation. Plus we were the only guest at the restaurant at that time. He not once came to our table. Me and my husband were not looking for a free meal or anything free for that matter because we ate the dish. As a manager you should be concerned with all guest especially returning guest. Unfortunately we won't ever be coming here again.","date":"2018-01-09 20:53:42"}

My trusty downtown barber finally moved away, forcing me to find a new one. I thought \"Lakeway is booming, we have a Torchy's and a huge HEB...we must have a decent barber!\" \n\nLiberty barbershop follows the old-school barbershop trend that seems to be resurging. I absolutely despise the chain barbershops that want to take down your personal info before giving you a haircut. Every time I think I'm desperate enough to venture to one of \"those\" places, I hear the fellas in front of me dutifully handing over their name, address, and phone number, and I bolt. Just cut my damn hair.\n\nDespite the fact that this is a small, two person operation, they're packed. I watched them turn away four people during my short stint in the chair, on a random Thursday afternoon. This means utilizing their online booking system is pretty much mandatory. \n\nTyler is super talkative, as are the other patrons there waiting. Three of us ended up spanning a broad range of topics in a pretty short period of time. It was a bit surreal, it genuinely felt like a neighborhood barbershop, despite this being the first time I'd ever stepped foot in the place.\n\nPrices are very reasonable, especially given how much attention Tyler pays to your hair. We spent 7-8 minutes just discussing options for my weird shaped head, and he really put me at ease. I think I've found my new barber!\n\nProtip: Every service is $2 off if you pay with cash!","date":"2017-05-13 14:31:40"}

Take the first of the two or you will be rejected and told to turn around.

Easy to find in this huge complex and a quick exit when leaving. The room was fine but lacking shampoo that was quickly rectified with a call to guest services. I didn't spend much time in the room but found it quiet and comfortable. I did like the Bose system in the living room while watching some TV.\n\nThe place is loaded with things to do but I had no time to indulge. There are seven pools to choose from with three of them open until 1am. I saw some tennis courts and several inviting hammocks as well.\n\nCheckout was quick and painless the next morning.

I don't want the bread, but it's just poor management if you cannot bring bread to the table before apps. (Yes, I used to be a server)\n\nCalamari - It is delicious but it is not your typical calamari. It is served under an Asian slaw with no dipping sauce.\nJumbo Crab Cake - This is definitely jumbo, and definitely crab. It is one large patty with a TON of crab. This was also very good and the roulade it is served with is not bad at all.\nTempura Lobster Tail - This was good, and I am pretty sure they left it on the shell so we had no doubt that it was worth the 33 dollars. I would rather get the lobster boiled but the appetizer just came fried.\n\nPanko-Crusted Halibut - this was the special and the fish itself was fresh, but the flavoring was on the bland side and not enjoyable\nBone-in Filet - asked for medium and got medium-well. It was dry and lacked flavor.\nFilet - not bad, but was nothing to write home about. I can make this better with the right cut of meat.\nAhi-Tuna - this definitely lacked flavor, but then again the person who got it wanted it to be medium.

I've used their service for five years, and I've never had a problem until this year. So I went to H&R's website, called their online number (basically useless), and then decided to make a one hour appointment at one of their branches. Things to know about this H&R Block location:\n\nPARKING: The lot, which is shared with other businesses in the strip mall, is absolutely tiny. So finding a spot during peak hours might be difficult. The traffic in this part of Buckhead is terrible, too. \n\nSCHEDULING: Even though you might be able to grab a walk-in spot, it's better to make an appointment on the H&R Block website. Super easy.\n\nWAITING: You'll likely wait five-ten plus minutes. There are a few chairs in the waiting room and complimentary coffee. You might also listen to the receptionist and other staff members unprofessionally gossip.\n\nSERVICE: After waiting fifteen minutes or so past my appointment time, I met with a very nice gentleman in his cubicle. I really didn't like the fact that they don't have rooms and only cubicles, because it feels uncomfortable discussing personal financial information out loud when people in the lobby can easily hear. (There's no music playing or anything, too.) \n\nThe man that worked with me basically said that he couldn't help me because he didn't understand my W-2s. He also couldn't even offer a solution, for me. Instead, I had to pitch them to him, and he just agreed with whatever I said (and seemed to just want me gone). \n\nSo, basically, I wasted about an hour of and a half of my time visiting this place. For next year, I plan to hire an accountant. \n\nCould the people here  help you with your taxes? Sure.

I hate sauerkraut and bratwurst and all that stuff. It's too heavy and it's not my thing. So I really wasn't expecting to like Schmidt's and was very pleasantly surprised when I did.\n\nIt's tucking away in German village. I'd never actually seen the place before because I don't venture around those parts much. But we were going here with the purpose of trying it out because I've heard so many good things. I wanted to be adventurous. \n\nThe place was very busy. It was around 7 on a Thursday night. But I liked the atmosphere. Very German, but not overbearingly so. There were some men in liederhosen and they were the band that was playing German music. They did a few requests and popular songs German style. The Simpsons and Family Theme songs come to mind.\n\nWe couldn't come here and not try some of the beers. Some of what they have is from the Elevator's Brewery. I had the Hefeweizen all night. I was disappointed to find that they didn't have any sort of happy hour, but oh well. The beer was excellent and served with a lemon wedge on the glass.\n\nWe decided to try the Schmidt's Famous Pretzel Nuggets as an appetizer. But - our server forgot to put the order in and we didn't get them until after we already had our food. That kinda sucked. But they were delicious - they were fried, but no batter so they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sweet honey mustard dipping sauce was addicting.\n\nI wasn't too sure what to order since I don't like German and just about everything on the menu was bratwurst and stuff like that. So I went with the Bahama Burger Special. The \"Bahama Mama\" is what this place is famous for. It's their specialty brat that's spicy. I wanted to try it, but wasn't sure. This dish comes with it in the form of a burger, so the cut is like a patty and there's no casing, which sounded good to me. It also came on a pretzel bun with tomato, onion and lettuce and swiss cheese. And guess what? I loved it. It was amazing. Not as spicy as I hoped, but I really liked it. I got the potato pancakes with applesauce as my side. They were good, little round cakes that were good dipped in the chunky applesauce. Yummy, but not all that great.\n\nJeff got the Bahama Mama platter, which came with cole slaw, potato salad, and was a huge brat on top of sauerkraut. It also came with a big toasted bun. He loved it.\n\nFor dessert we knew we had to get cream puffs. They are huge and look delicious - there is a display case filled with them right when you walk in the door. A clever marketing strategy if I ever saw one. It works. We were planning to share one but couldn't agree on one. So we got two, which ended up being insane because there was no way we could eat it all. He ate about half of his and I only managed about 5 or 6 bites of mine. Jeff got the chocolate one. It was a light fluffy sauce that wasn't at all too much chocolate. It was topped with powdered sugar and chocolate drizzle. I got the special buckeye one that was filled with light peanut butter cream and topped with this fudgy chocolate and nuts. Wonderful. I'm not a huge cream puff fan, but these were great.\n\nOur server was nice. He gave us one of our cream puffs half off because of the appetizer trouble. I wish we just gave us the pretzels for free, though. At $5.25 per puff, we didn't get much of a discount. And our bill was crazy! About $70 for all this food and beer. I guess it wasn't awful, but still. I wish this place was cheaper, but I did have enough left over for another meal. Jeff didn't, though.\n\nI will come back for sure, but I'll know that it can get pricey. But I was really impressed with how much I liked it despite my dislike for German foods. It won me over, but the appetizer service and prices knock one star off.","date":"2009-03-01 02:09:18"}

After a second baby, a return to work, and pneumonia, I had given up cleaning. My friend gave me her Revolutions Cleanings groupon and I gave them a call. I think the only downside of the experience was scheduling. They have 2 phone numbers and one doesn't have a voicemail box. The other one says \"due to high call volume, please visit our website\" (which makes no sense as the website has no place to contact them except through the phone). I got a call 2 days after my first voicemail and they scheduled something for the following week. The next day they called to reschedule for one day later. They texted me to confirm my address - smart because I didn't feel that we were understanding each other that well over the phone.\nThen, when they were supposed to come, no one came. They were an hour and fifteen minutes late. I called, couldn't get ahold of anyone, and then got a call back explaining that the cleaners were running late. Fine, but if you knew that you should've called me. If I had time to sit around at home waiting for someone to come over I'd be cleaning my own damn house.\nI have 2 kids and a hairy dog. My house hadn't been cleaned in a month. It was filthy. I expected with a 3 hour groupon they'd do the 2 bathrooms and I would feel like a new person. Maybe they'd sweep the kitchen. Boy was I wrong. Two people came and worked for 2 hours (which is really like FOUR hours on a 3hr groupon, so AWESOME) and they did 2 bathrooms, 1 kitchen, and tidied up in 3 bedrooms. We're talking top to bottom in the bathrooms - windows, mirrors, toilets, sinks, tub grout, EXHAUST FANS ARE YOU KIDDING I LOVE YOU. The kitchen was sparkly and clean in a way I'd never seen it. They cleaned the stainless steel everywhere. I think I should probably do that, it really does look nice. They cleaned the toaster and the microwave. I went to get dishwasher detergent and discovered they'd cleaned out the nasty cupboard under the sink. They cleaned the plastic drippy thing you put your hand washed dishes on. In the bedrooms, they dusted every surface including the ceiling fans. They made all of our beds. I'm sure there is even more I have yet to discover, but I was impressed they did the two bathrooms so well - everything else is icing on the cake. I'd give them 5 stars but this is just the first time. I want to see how it goes next month when I invite them back, especially because I don't know how much it would cost to repeat what they did today. For the cost of the groupon this was an amazing value.\nOh - per the other reviewers, I am not sure if they brought their own stuff. I have a bathroom closet stocked with cleaning supplies and there was some sort of bleach spray bottle cleaner on the bathroom counter that may or may not have been mine (seriously, I am a lazy cleaner). They did use a LOT of my paper towels. Their website says they have non-bleach alternatives, but I didn't look at their website until after I'd scheduled their services and they clearly used bleach. It reeks of bleach in the house, but small price to pay for the stunning beauty of 90% of my living space.","date":"2012-12-05 01:44:40"}

Oh, they also have cheap shots (depends on day) here.  2 for $5.\n\nWhile I've never had the food here, the one thing that makes me chuckle is the $15 Wonton Soup on the menu.

I've been to this restaurant quite a few times and have always had good service and decent food.  That is, until today.  \n\nGilbert's won't get a nickel from me again. I have never been treated as rudely and disrespectfully as I was this morning by the manager who was on duty for brunch. \n\nMy friends and I wanted to sit next to the window, which is an openable overhead door similar to a garage door but glass panes.

However this was not a question - - it was a statement - - meaning, \"I am opening this overhead door\".  \n\nI objected and asked that he not open the door due to the coldness outside.

We declined the offer at first since we were in no hurry and it truly didn't bother us that much but they were very adamant about it so we caved.

The service is top notch, and selection is great. Unfortunately most of food just isn't that great.\n\nIf you need a thai fix it may suffice but it's nothing crave-able about the fare they serve. There is a lunch special that comes with free appetizer buffet. It's a great deal if you're looking to save some cash, but again the food is only meh. \n\nNoodles, curry, tofu, meat, it's all just meh. Many of the other reviews mention Titayas which for Austin is the pinnacle of Thai perfection. These two restaurants aren't even in the same ecosystem of quality or taste.\n\nI think you should try this place out, and it's possible that they improve over time.

EVERRR!\n\nMy boyfriend went to Portland pre-me and apparently had the best brownie ever. He told me about it a few times and how he wanted to go back and get some more.  I am famous for my sweet tooth so, although I like sweets, it's pretty hard to impress me. I didn't doubt that the brownie was good but wasn't quite to the point that it could be THAT good.  So, when we were planning out next little trip, the trip revolved around the brownie.\n\nWe flew from L.A. so that we could go back and see if the brownie place was still there and if it was really THAT good.\n\nIt was.\n\nHe couldn't remember the name but he remembered landmarks-- like Restoration Hardware across the street.  I'm pretty good at finding stuff (I really should be a P.I.) and of course found it.\n\nAs we were walking up, I swear I could feel him shaking from excitement. But I could also tell that he was trying to hold it back as he was afraid of getting disappointed.  What if the brownie wasn't really that good?  \n\nWe crossed the street to the little stand and anxiously awaited for the people in front of of us to finish ordering. When it was our turn, it was a big womp, womp, womp.  Because it was hot that day (80 degrees- in Portland!!!), they didn't make it. Brownies didn't sell in hot weather.  Shane, the guy at the stand, was super nice and told us that if we promised to come back, he will have some ready for us the following day.\n\nAnd so we went back. And he had brownies. And THE. BEST. BROWNIES. EVER.\n\nThe Boyfriend purchased three: one for each of us and another for my friend.  My friend ate hers.  He ate his on the way down to a chocolate shop down the block. He finished a brownie in less than fifteen minutes.  And so he bought another one on our way back up.\n\nI don't even know how to describe the brownies.  It's sweet, but not to sweet. There is a sweet, slightly bitter (from the espresso) taste but it's almost an after taste.  It's gooey in the middle and lightly flaky on top.  It was really delicious.  I have high standards when it comes to sweets and this was definitely the best brownie I have ever had.","date":"2015-06-08 18:00:52"}

If I had the option, I'd probably give them 2.5 starts rather than 2, but I couldn't justify a 3 and you can't do half stars, so....\n\nOur first impression was great. We loved their selection, and their prices seemed comparable to other party rental places (which are all way overpriced, in my opinion, but that's another story). The woman we worked with in the showroom was FANTASTIC. Can't say enough good things about her. So nice, so patient, and so helpful.\n\nThe reason for the not-so-great review is that their delivery was late (really threw a wrench in our schedule the day before the wedding and made us scramble to get everything ready in time), but mainly because of the way they responded when some of their rentals were not in proper working order. Our caterer had requested that we order a large propane grill, which we did. Unfortunately, when she arrived to start cooking the day of our wedding (the day after the rentals were delivered), she found that the propane was leaking and only half of the grill was working. Our caterer was amazing and somehow still managed to get dinner done (later than planned, but what can you do with half a working grill when most of your menu is grilled?!), but it was a massive inconvenience. \n\nAfter the wedding, both the caterer and the venue owner told us they thought we should let the Party Place know about the problem, and they both expected they would be decent enough to offer us a refund for the cost of the grill, since it created such a problem on our wedding day. So we emailed them when we got the final bill and requested a refund for the grill... and about a week later got a response saying, \"I split the cost of the bbq with you since you did use 1\/2 of it.  I am wondering if anyone called us when they found it wasn't working to see if we could trouble shoot over the phone and possibly help to have it fixed as it may have been something minor.\"\n\nI'm sorry, but we thought that response was really lame. Way to dodge taking responsibility for your malfunctioning equipment. No, our caterer didn't have a chance to call because she was working like mad trying to salvage our wedding dinner with half of your grill not working! And we were on a ranch with poor cell coverage (which we had notified your staff of ahead of time)! \n\nIt was only a grill in our case that wasn't working, so it could have been much worse, but I'd hate to think about how much someone might get screwed over if something more costly didn't work as it was supposed to.","date":"2011-10-28 02:46:51"}

We were here on a Sunday I believe, there 3 choices for the ramen and 2 choices for the side orders. Chicken karaage and pot stickers. I read one of the reviewers raving about the pot stickers, so I decided to order it as well. This is how unmemorable this place was too me, as I write this review down I couldn't even for the love of me remember the type of ramen I ordered. I wasn't keen in eating anything spicy that early in the day so I opt out on the ramen that didn't offer any heat at all. We ordered at the counter and service was quick and friendly. I really wanted to like this place, but it was such a disappointment. The ramen, was just okay. I've definitely had better and for $10 bucks, I've expected more. The pot stickers were nothing impressive to what the other reviewer was raving about. Maybe, I'll return in a different day and see what their menu is like?

Nice enough that it makes me sadder to have to give this low star rating.  \n\nI went in to get a to-go order. I asked if I could order dishes without MSG. I was told YES. Yay! There was a bit of a wait, but nothing outlandish. So far so good.\n\nI really wanted to like it. It did not meet expectations and would not have even if I had never read all the stellar reviews.\n\nI ordered sesame tofu -- and got the lunch deal so I could try the hot and sour soup and eggroll. I paid $1 extra for the rice to be fried rice.\n\nResults: Eggroll just bad and greasy (went into trash); was given 1\/4-1\/3 cup of fried rice - even though I paid $1 extra to have fried rather than steamed rice. It was definitely not enough rice to go with the sesame tofu. I deserved at least one more small scoop of rice for the extra dollar I should think. The little I had of it tasted good. Very, very disappointed on the teen-niney portion of rice!\n\nThe sesame tofu tasted good (though a bit too sweet for my taste). I would have registered no complaint however if it were not for the several inch-plus long black-burnt chile pepper in it. Don't get me wrong. I love hot and I have no problem with chile peppers in my food. Which is why at first I thought it was just part of the meal -- until I tried to eat them. They felt and tasted dry and burnt. I took some time out to fish them out. \n\nThe hot and sour soup? One of the worst I have ever had. I could detect neither the hot nor the sour. It looked and tasted to me more like egg drop soup, because it had (really too much) egg in it.  I'm a hot and sour soup lover -- so this was another major disappointment. I could not bring myself to finish this tasteless soup.\n\nI paid nearly $10 for a bad egg roll, yucky soup, a smidgeon of rice and tofu heavily laden with a sauce full of burnt-black peppers. Oh, and there was an unexpected \"treat\" of some kind of fried wheat something or other. Tasteless and unhealthy to boot, that also went in the trash.\n\nNot a happy camper. I do not believe I will be back -- but then again, maybe just for the green beans with vegetarian fried rice in a pinch.\n\nI feel certain Gordon Ramsay would agree with me on this one! \n\nP.S. I love the fortunes in their fortune cookies. Words of wisdom -- very cool.\n\nUPDATE:  A couple days after I posted this review a friend came over with takeout to share with me -- from this same restaurant~! She brought two takeout orders of the shrimp lunch deal with vegetable fried rice. She was given only a tiny portion of the fried rice (explained above). \n\nOne the positive side, the eggrolls were MUCH better this time. i believe it is because the eggroll I was given before must have been a leftover and cooked twice (not cool). \n\nHowever, this time what was old was the fried shrimp. The batter on some pieces of it were so stale my teeth could not go through them. \n\nThe soup was probably egg drop this time; I really could not tell. It was below par to my tastebuds. \n\nThey need to learn one very important thing: KEEP IT FRESH. I have been served \"way too old\" in two different items on two different days in the past week, so I'll stick with the 2-star rating.\n\nIf I ordered from there again I would just say no when offered the \"lunch deal,\" knowing I would get a decent amount of rice with the dish.","date":"2013-06-24 17:11:52"}

The decor is very cool and comfortable and the bar in the middle was really neat looking and I am excited to go back and sit at it. \n\nFood wise...we started with pimento crab dip and was so good! It tasted like a delicious cream cheese crab ball! It came with thinly toasted pieces of bread. \n\nEntrees...sort of bad news first, the sides were just okay. I got the spicy Mac and cheese and it was a little too spicy.  However, the croutons in the side salad were delicious and I ate those first. \n\nGREAT NEWS... I got ribs and they were AWESOME! They were very meaty and very tender! I got the half slab and it was enough for two meals for me. There were four different sauces on the table to choose from! I liked three out of four (I get that The Carolina Mustardy flavor is not for everyone). My friend got the brisket and said hers was also delicious! \n\nI am excited to go back for two reasons...1) their sandwiches sounded delicious and 2) Their meats are gluten free and I have a niece who has celiacs who likes barbecue!

First (and most importantly) was the service itself.\n\nI was looking to have four new tires installed on my car and I wanted a specific brand of tire (Dunlop). After researching it online, I discovered that Mr. Tire's price was low enough that it beat ordering tires from Tirerack.com and paying for shipping. As a bonus, Mr. Tire was able to get the tires installed the same day I called them, unlike other local shops that couldn't get them in for 2-3 days. Same day was important with the first big snow storm coming.\n\nThe installation went fine. Not unexpectedly, my car also needed an alignment. After having the tires installed and alignment done, I left. A short drive told me there was something \"off\" with alignment so I drove right back. The mechanic at Mr. Tire immediately put my car back on the alignment rack and tightened it up a bit more. I drove away a satisfied customer, other than having to clean the mechanic's greasy hand prints off my steering wheel. So, the service gets four stars.\n\nI will give the shop itself only two stars. There was no Wi-Fi. No cable TV, just local over-the-air TV with poor reception. No water, only terrible coffee to drink. The bathroom was dirty. It wasn't a very pleasant place, like it was built in the 70's and has never been upgraded.","date":"2013-12-07 15:15:48"}

Other facilities offered group and trail ride lessons but I wanted individual attention taught by a competent instructor who had personal accomplishments as part of their own resume. \nI have been thrilled by the quality of instruction given my 5 year old granddaughter. We started out with a trial lesson with Rachel to make sure that my granddaughter was serious and not frightened by the actual size of the horses, not coloring book characters. All went well and we started out with one lesson a week and moved up to two lessons plus recently she attended a wonderful week long horse camp which ended today, taught by Carly another terrific instructor, with many championships under her belt.\nMy granddaughter has progressed tremendously thanks to the competent instruction of Rachel and Carly. She is excited about riding and counts the days from the end of one lesson until the next one. The kids learn about tacking and untacking as part of caring for the riding lesson.\nThe facility is beautiful, clean and well run. They offer boarding if you own a horse too. The patrons are friendly and helpful.\nTo summarize, Madrone Ranch Stables has exceeded my expectations. My granddaughter is happy and and safe at the facility. The stables are perfect for the serious rider, but slouchers need not apply.","date":"2013-07-13 02:20:09"}

The over all atmosphere was  ritzy, nice, and very clean. The movie was displayed nicely and the seats were very cushiony and comfortable. I didn't realize I paid for the cheaper seats that do not offer food service and that was really inconvenient. The lady at the front told me I could order at my seat but I guess she was wrong. I had four kids with me and my husband had to stay with them while I brought out food for everyone...I felt like I was interrupting other people....and I missed a lot of the movie. Our dinner, dessert, Alcohol, and tickets added up to $230. An employee whom I believe was a manger, saw me carrying a lot of food on my own so he offered to help, which was very nice of him but when I grabbed the tray from him half of my 15$ pizza fell on the floor and they didn't offer to bring out a replacement, that made me upset. I spent a lot of money with them and he saw I was struggling, I just think that they should have done something about it. Another thing I really didn't like...I saw him touch his face at the food counter and then pick up some fries it his bare hands and place them in our dish. They hype up the food with the names and the price as if your getting some amazing gourmet meal, and don't get me wrong they also present it well, but it was like cafeteria grade food if you get what I mean....not good...not worth those outrages prices. This just goes to show you looks are not everything....it looks awesome and its comfortable....but so is the movie house off 620 and there prices are a tad cheaper and the overall experience dining and all was much better and they had really unique menu and the food was amazing and everyone gets service regardless of the seating.","date":"2015-06-21 00:16:02"}

Our group of four was told there would be an hour wait.  Luckily, Lucky Strike has plenty of lounge type seating so we hung out and had a couple drinks.

Also, the bartender was pretty terrible, see below.  The wait ended up being almost two hours.\n\nBartender....\nTo the bartender that made the drinks last night who was really busy talking to her coworkers and not listening to me.  I ordered a Jack and Ginger, not a Jack and Coke and a Raspberry Vodka and Soda Water with a lime, not a Raspberry Whatever and Sprite with no lime.  \n\nBowling...\nIt was fun.

It had 3 chicken tenders, 2 mozzarella sticks, and two spring rolls for $15 - not worth it.  Go to some bar down the street, get some awesome bar food, and call it a night.\n\nDespite my bitching, I'd probably go back.  Overall it was fun night.

You can walk in a complete exercise novice and never for one second feel intimidated, or you can walk in as someone who has been working out for years and be challenged.  I've done a tour of S. Austin group exercise classes, so let me tell you why Nick and Juanita are the best trainers around:\n\n1) They challenge you.  After a year and a half, I'm still being challenged every single time I come in for a class.  The weights can always be heavier and you can always move them faster.\n\n2) They plan the workouts intentionally.  I've been to classes where the instructors seem to be pulling exercises out of thin air.  I'm paying for a trainer because I want them to have thought about what muscle groups I need to be working.\n\n3) They can laugh.  What's worse than an exhausting workout with trainers who need you to know that working out is THE MOST SERIOUS THING?  Believe me, it's a serious workout, but let's not get carried away.  \n\n4) They pay attention.  They'll (nicely) correct your form so you get the most out of your workout and don't hurt yourself.  They're also great at giving modifications if you've got an injury or a particular workout is just more than you can handle (yet!).\n\n5) The other people.  You'll be in a room full of women who are all there to train harder and get stronger, but with nothing to prove.  And bonus, there are no annoying men. \n\nIf you're looking for a gym with a beautiful facility and flashy marketing, GiG probably isn't your thing.  But if you're more interested in getting results with an efficient workout and great trainers, you won't be disappointed.","date":"2015-08-19 11:27:38"}

I prefer the Chile rice for something different as it is not the standard  Spanish rice. They also have 2 bean options charro which is a broths bean option and refried.

But it so deserves it anyway.  So F it.\n\nMy sister has been raving to me about Barley Swine every time I have visited since its opening.  She and her husband frequent the place often and typically sit at the bar and have gotten to know Billie quite well.  And after meeting her, they were totally correct in thinking she is an awesome and congenial bartender\/server.  In fact, we let her know we were coming in and she saved us two bar stools - thanks Billie!\n\nIt's tight quarters at Barley Swine, so I can see why people make sure to arrive right at opening - tables fill up quickly...thank goodness for the two bar seats awaiting our arrival!\n\nWe started out splitting a bottle of Red Blend from Israel - it was one of the best blends I've had in awhile.  Highly recommend if blends are your thing.\n\nNow onto the food...we had the grilled broccoli (a great starter, perfectly executed), the cauliflower (you would think this might be too similar to the broccoli to order both - you'd be incorrect  - I loved this plate), the sweet potato (this fell in my top three - loved the mix of flavors), the pig ankle (this came with a trio of different parts of the pig and scored a position in my top three plates as well), the goat dish (okay, I'm starting to feel like a Swine myself as I list all of this off), the goat cheese mousse (insert more foodie talk here), and lastly the lamb which my sister and I agreed was our favorite dish of the night.  I could go on about why each dish worked, but I don't know why each dish worked...they just did, and the presentation was spot on.  \n\nI apparently caught the eye of the pastry chef, who sent out a free dessert he had concocted and once again, it did not disappoint (see photo).

I stopped in here for lunch last week after a nearby appointment.  While the menu seems very fun and inviting for the adventurous diner, I guess I just wasn't in the mood to spend $19 on a burger and rings.\n\nIn all fairness, the food was good, just not outstanding.  I had the lamburger ($12), which was enjoyable, but there was WAY too much going on under the bun.  Let's see...marinated (read 'pickled') vegetables, arugula and pickled onions, citrus goat cheese, tzaziki sauce and, oh yeah, the burger!  IMO, they should scrap everything pickled and stick with the  basics; burger, cheese, arugula and sauce...maybe a mango chutney or something.  They should learn the lesson that simplicity is highly underrated.  The onion rings ($4 for about 10 rings) were also good, but I've had better for less.  Not sure what beer mustard is, but is tasted an awful lot like light honey mustard.  Not offensive, they just expended lots of effort where they could have backed off and let the food speak for itself.\n\nThe people couldn't have been nicer, and very attentive.  The place was busy at 2:00pm on a Friday, which says something.  I'm going back at some point for just a regular old burger.  Hopefully, it'll change my mind...","date":"2012-06-26 13:50:32"}

I bought my BMW from Herb Chambers BMW, because my father bought it there; I bought it from the same guy, and I didn't haggle. The truth is I didn't have to haggle, because the guy gave me all the coupons\/rebates available, and made the financing process go extremely fast, and painlessly.\n\nAfter I sold my BMW I was in the market for a more value-priced Honda Accord. I asked for a referral from said gentleman (Kevin Bugby at Herb Chambers BMW). He referred me to a sales person at Herb Chambers Honda that would 'take care of me'. I assumed there would be an equal level of service as what I was accustomed to. Boy was I wrong.\n\nFor starters, when I got there (at the scheduled time), he was busy with another customer and handed me off to another sales person. Not a big deal, I know i'm not the only customer out there. I agreed to test drive with this person, after which I asked to speak to my original sales person. I was informed that they were still busy and that this new guy could help me; not a chance, I insisted on waiting, and waited for another good 15 minutes before my original sales person saw me.\n\nI won't delve into the details of the conversation, but after doing substantial research on car prices, I discovered that Herb Chambers Honda was pricing their cars substantially above market value. I pointed this out, and was repeatedly told that this dealership does NOT lower its prices. Fine; but where was the white glove hand holding, where was the loyalty reward for being a Herb Chambers repeat customer. I was treated like a pest off the street. \n\nIn the end I bought a car substantially below Edmunds TMV at a smaller dealership. While that experience also left much to be desired, that dealer worked with me on the price and priced it competitively even though they didn't have to. \n\nWhy 1 star? Because when I buy a car from a dealership, and my father buys a car from that dealership, I expect to be treated better than some guy off the street the third time I go in for a car.

In fact, one could question why the rodeo is still a thing, but when in Rome..) \n\nParking: $10 and some serious, albeit necessary, control freaks directing where you should park. I would suggest carpooling.\n\nFood: We missed the bbq competition by a week but managed to find our share of good fried food. The smoked turkey legs were yummy and could feed a small family; the bratwurst with sauerkraut was pretty good (I grew up in Deutschland, so I'm pretty particular) and the funnel cake was huge-- three of us barely finished it. \n \nRides: lots of scary rides to ride but alas, we did not ride the scary rides this time.\n\nRodeo: This portion lasts 2 hours, the music for about an hour. The calf-ropin' makes me cringe and I could do without, but I enjoyed the barrel raising. I also liked the bull and horse riding but I do wonder what the cowfolks do to piss them off so. After watching Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, I couldn't help but wonder what other shenanigans go on backstage. \n\nMusic: Willie and his family put on a good show. I love me some Willie (yes, that's what she said) but with the exception of a few tunes, he seemed to say the words more than sing them, as if he were reading poetry set to music. His son belted out a SRV tune, which I did not expect. Still, I hope Willie was just not feeling great that night. He has such a unique singing voice. Nonetheless, I'm so glad I went. My first concert ever was a Willie Nelson show with my family 35 years ago. I did not want to go way back then because I thought I was a lot more rock than country and so I pretended to hate it, but am secretly glad my parents made me go. \n\nCurrency: bring cash.

Dunno, really. But my first Hopdoddy experience wasn't the greatest. Had a couple of out of town visitors for the day and we all decided to try Hopdoddy for lunch. The line to get in, which is normally down the block, was fairly short and manageable. My high hopes were lifted even more because of that. The line inside forms right down the middle of the restaurant. Which meant that my guests and I were asked to move out of a servers way many more times than once. Most were nice about it; you can't help being in the way because of how the line is set up. One server, who was apparently having a very bad day, was not so nice about it. He was downright rude, actually. And, no. We were not standing in the areas where signs directed us not to stand. We were merely standing in line waiting to order our food. We finally get to the counter to order. 2 burgers. 1 salad. Order of truffle fries. 2 milkshakes. 1 beer. Over $70 with tax and tip. That's a lot of money for a burger joint. I was also a little taken aback at being asked to tip before any service was given. But I did tip, because I appreciate and respect the work of food service workers. Got our table. Nice young woman brings our order. The truffle fries were amazing. Best part of the whole meal. Milkshakes were good, but not $6 each good. The burgers were the biggest disappointment. The other burger orderer at my table said his was ok, but not nearly as good as he had thought it might be. I took a bite of his. His assessment was correct. It was just a decent burger, nothing special. Mine was grossly undercooked in the middle. Our server never came back to the table to check on us and a very kind young man offered to go find her. She finally showed up after I had eaten the cooked edges of the burger and was no longer in the mood for the rest of it, cooked or not. I didn't really want another burger at that point. I didn't want what was left of the one I had to be cooked some more. Maybe I would have wanted those things 30-40 minutes earlier if she had ever come back to the table. She didn't offer any of those things, anyway, so it was a good thing I didn't want them, I suppose. She apologized that my burger was so undercooked. And left. I was appreciative that I at least got that. Maybe I went to Hopdoddy on a bad day. Maybe another visit would prove more satisfying. Not sure yet, whether I'm willing to give it another try or not. Those truffle fries sure were good, though. But, still.","date":"2016-12-19 15:15:27"}

I tried the very excellent farm fresh pizza, which included what amounted to a tasty salad on top of a nice, thin crust (just the way I like it).

She was super friendly and very attentive to us.\n\nMy husband and I showed up for lunch today. It wasn't crowded at all so we chose the corner table beside the window. I chose the cod fish and chips with sweet potato fries along with a cup of coffee, and my husband got a half shrimp louie, crab pepper cheese soup, and an oyster shooter, with a vanilla Porter to drink.\n\nEverything was delivered to our table timely and hot.\n\nThe cod needed a bit of salt and pepper maybe, but it's a bland fish so I didn't expect much. I feel like the beer batter would have been a better choice so that's on me. The tartar sauce was good and made l for the cods lack of flavor. The fries however... Not only were they pretty close to burnt, but they're definitely frozen from a bag and not worth the upcharge at all. For a $13 meal it was unacceptable. \n\nMy husband liked the oyster shooter and I thought the cocktail sauce tasted really yummy. His salad however, he wasn't as happy with. For a 1\/2 size portion the price was fair and it was huge, but although the shrimp was piled high he claimed they were soggy and water-logged like canned shrimp. If it is canned, that is pretty disappointing for a sea food place. \n\nIf there is anything at all worth coming back for, it's that crab pepper cheese soup. Amazing! By far the most flavorful thing we ordered. I don't know if we will go back, but if we do it will be because we're craving soup! \n\nBut all together it's on the pricy side for pretty middle-of-the road food. This place should definitely consider doing fresh cut fries. It was incredibly sad to see a fish and chips place using frozen chips.\n\nI'm sure we'll be back for a second try sometime, but first impressions are difficult to erase.","date":"2016-03-07 04:42:52"}

The experience we shared that night really left a tremendous impression on our hearts and palates. I don't recall the name of our server that night but the gentleman really took care of us from greeting to goodbye. I had the most tender, buttery red fish I've ever eaten. My Wife ate shrimp which she equally enjoyed- not rubbery or undercooked. We shared potatoes and spinach. Then they brought us desert and wow the cake tasted fluffy, light and just sweet enough to enjoy. We got out of there after dropping a nice bit of change but it was well worth it.

The opening band sounded terrible but the headliner sounded great, so whatever you make of that. I was on the floor but being up on the higher levels must have really sucked for those people because you can't see anything if you're not in front. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the bartenders were cool and everybody was smoking tons of weed and security didn't even try to stop it!(it was a reggae show)","date":"2017-09-09 02:57:18"}

It's not easy, it's not cheap, and it's not for everyone--but taught effectively, it gives a person tools for improving and measuring physical function across many domains.\n\nBefore moving to Atlanta, I worked out at a Crossfit gym with coaches who'd had years of experience in coaching various athletics, and who also had a background in physical therapy and\/or exercise science. They knew how to teach people to do the movements safely, and how to motivate people to work hard, even when it hurts. This made them outstanding coaches not just for elite athletes, but also for people like me. My experience at that gym was life-changing.\n\nI'd had trouble finding the same level of knowledge and skill at a Crossfit gym in Atlanta, until now. The two coaches--one male, one female--who run this gym have many years of experience coaching both Crossfit and other sports. Combined, they also have academic background and higher levels of certification that come across in the way they're able to figure out what I'm doing wrong with a certain movement, or how to improve mobility in a certain joint. The programming is created by the coaches, who are consistently attentive and helpful.\n\nBecause the place is new, classes are currently small.  On any given day, I work out with people about at my level or less experienced, and with people who could bench-press me with one hand. Parking behind the gym is plentiful. Most patrons are friendly, although one of the owners was downright crusty to me on my first day here, which was a minor downer. I got over it, because the coaching is great, but others might not be so tolerant. I would love if it were easier to put my membership on hold when I travel, and am holding out hope that becomes an option somewhere down the road.\n\nRegardless of some of these bumps, I think this place has what it takes to be an incredible resource to a lot of people at different levels of fitness, and I'm delighted it's in the neighborhood.","date":"2013-10-03 17:00:05"}

It is kind of loud, I think I've mentioned in other reviews that I find some of the patrons here really annoying, like that sketch from SNL, \"Two A-holes Go To...\" a coffeeshop.  People talking really dumb stuff really loud.  I'm sure I'm really annoying to other people when I'm hanging out with my friends and we're dissecting text messages and talking about shoes and boobs.\n\nAlso, the general coffeeshop noises: espresso machine, clearing the brew basket dealy, it all sounds really loud, maybe since the floor in concrete and the rest of the space is glass and stone.\n\n2. Refills cost $.50.  :(\n\n3. The bathroom is in the hallway, outside of the store, which is weird.  Especially if you're already all splayed out so I know I won't stay longer than a couple hours at most.\n\n4. Sugar is in packets and not a pourer.  Sugar packet waste makes the dirty Austin hippie inside me sad.  \n\n5. No pourer for the half and half. \n\n6. Wifi is fast and reliable. \n\n7. Food choices are pretty good Torchy's breakfast tacos, stuff from G's Deli, other baked goods and whatnot.\n\n8.  Summermoon Latte Milk.  It's good  The longer you sit here, the more times you'll hear the baristas making up stories about where it comes from. Maybe it comes from cows that live on the moon in the summer.  I don't know.  Just drink it and don't ask.  These baristas answer this question at least twice an hour.  I feel sorry for them.\n\n9. Clientele: are we all a little chubby from the Summermoon milk? probably.  Mostly college kids, a couple good looking hipster types.  Not enough to warrant people watching though.  \n\nStill a strong contender for working remotely, especially since I have to come here occasionally to refill my iced coffee bottles.","date":"2013-03-18 17:32:36"}

The food, the music, the staff, all interesting (in a good way). Overall, I liked the food, but some of the dishes had components that could be improved. \n\nThe brocolini, ragu and toast was good bite when everything was combined, but as individual components, might be one of the most odd trio of items. I think I would prefer this dish pre-assembled to make sure the customer gets the memo on how it's supposed to be eaten. Eating the brocolini alone was horrible and lacking all flavor. Eating the ragu alone made me wonder where the pasta might be, and eating the toast alone made me think, there must be more. \n\nWho the F_ck is David Chang? Winner of the best dish name award by a long shot. The flavors are all there, but a bit heavy on the mayo sauce for me making everything very slippery in the bun. Also, the bun was well made, light and fluffy. \n\nThe shiso leaf wrapped \"tacos\" were interesting, but should have been wrapped with a different leafy green instead. The texture of the shiso is a bit waxy and not that enjoyable. I wanted a crisp crunch of some lettuce. \n\nMusic throughout the meal was awesome. They have a great mix going and I found myself looking up a few songs along throughout the meal. \n\nService was also top notch. The waitress was helpful, quick to refill water glasses and provide the check.","date":"2018-07-17 08:50:14"}

Been using H&R Block for more than a decade. This year the customer service was so bad it was confrontational, I was waiting for my appointment and an available agent offered to see me, the receptionist actually refused, saying \"she can wait\".  I CAN HEAR YOU, I'm literally two feet away. I bit my tongue since my partner was already seeing an agent. Then they argued with us about payment, and when we opted to have the payment taken out of our tax return, they \"LOST\" our return. It's now past tax day, and a month after we filed, and they're still giving us the runaround. You could chalk it up to a language barrier except my partner speaks Spanish. There's no excuse for such phenomenally bad customer service. We will never use this company again, wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.","date":"2017-04-19 14:32:40"}

My husbands band even played at the owners wedding.  So even though I am a bit partial, I am a bit of a waffle snob.  My favorite still remains the plain with butter and powdered sugar but I am a classic kind of gal.  The waffle is crisp on the outside, soft and not undercooked on the inside.  It is also refreshing to see some savory choices and they do live up to their namesakes expectation: Sausage and maple, TBH (turkey bacon havarti), delicious FLAVOUR.\n\nThe only complaint is my beef with the weather every time I crave a waffle it's always blustery or pouring.  Not the usual casual mist and clouds.  This is no reflection on Flavour spot.  You just have to bundle up, make sure you're waterproof and go on with life like a proud Oregonian should.","date":"2010-01-08 19:14:41"}
