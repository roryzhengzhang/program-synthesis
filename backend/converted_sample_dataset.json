        "text": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \n\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur√©e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \n\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

        "text": "Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \n\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \n\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.",

        "text": "I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\n\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\n\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

I was quoted $230. I went to another locksmith, who actually got my lock off, and was quoted a total of $79.\n\nThe technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician's offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!",

Although the restaurant\/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker.

Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \n\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service.

        "text": "I just had my lasik done last week and I am really happy with my results. The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\n\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \n\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \n\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\n\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.",

First off, let me say that when Barb asks you the simple questions, she follows through as you please. I hate when I request soft-medium and it's totally opposite. I received a free foot salt scrub due to a scheduling issue, not bad! When a company offers you something in addition due to a mistake on their part, take it! That's their way of apologizing indirectly! Awesome massage even without the add on! Cannot wait to book my next massage with her!",

        "text": "When we first arrived at the Coco Key, we were greeted by a number of staff members as we checked in, the process was slightly awkward because the staff appeared new or in training, which can happen from time to time. No harm no foul. \nThe foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. \nShortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \nYou're probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \nI am very much alive. However, I am very doubtful that I will ever return to the coco key.",

Maybe.\n\nRating the red line against other public transit services I've used in the US and abroad, no, it can't hold a candle to anything in Japan or some of the better Metro lines in Paris. But those lines are well-funded. That's simply not the case anywhere in the US.\n\nSimply because the T shuts down at night, it's cleaner than anything in NYC. Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough.  Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. \n\nLook, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect. It's in debt by several billion dollars. So they're not going to add any fancy new features or do any serious upgrading until they have money to pay for it.  So knowing all this, I'm still really quite happy with the red line.",

        "text": "\"A Bit Embarrassed\"\n\nI'm not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my - or everyone's- meal comped last night.\n\nYes, I'm doing the Eat On $30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!\n\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\n\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\n\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\n\nI have to say . . . I'm \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\n\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn't) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\n\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .",

I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\n\nIt's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\n\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too.",

Be forewarned that it's not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.\n\nPros\n  - BEST FRIED CHICKEN WE'VE EVER HAD...perfectly crispy skin with \n    great flavor. It seriously makes me not very excited to eat fried chicken \n    anytime soon because I know anywhere I go in Boston won't be as \n    good.\n  - Ribs with a nice, smokey taste\n  - Super mac n' cheese made with real cheese\n  - Dang good corn muffins you can munch on before your food arrives.\n\nCons\n  - Very busy so be prepared to wait (and you should because it's worth it)\n  - No air conditioning so in the summer it can get pretty toasty.  We were \n    there at the end of June and even with the fans going, it was warm.\n  - Sweet tea is too sweet for me\n\n**Note: There's a small parking lot as well as street parking.

We ordered escargot and artichoke to start. Escargot was covered in a bitter green sauce- butter and garlic would have really helped. The artichoke wasn't cooked properly and was minimally seasoned. It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. \n\nWe ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing.

        "text": "My husband and I shared the parmesan truffly fries. They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I'm a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \n\nJust a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.\n\nMy husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.\n\nWe ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.\n\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.",

However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don't expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald's Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it's FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant's help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...\n\nThe return was a breeze, you proceed to the designated lane and grab your stuff to go.

So worth it!\n\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\n\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\n\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\n\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\n\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese \/ gorgonzola yumminess.",

Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\n\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\n\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.\n\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.",

Gee, can you think of a more UNPLEASANT way to wake up at 7 a.m?

Where the hell did they find these people and please wherever it was send them back and get them off the damn radio or any job where they are actually required to speak for that matter.

Personally, I chose the mushroom rosemary gravy and I think that it was hands down the best gravy I had ever tried.\n\nI might has well licked the entire plate because it looked like it when I was finished.

Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.",

This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \n\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up!

I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\n\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \n\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.",

The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.

We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.",

        "text": "A few months back i went in for a toothache and ended up needing a root canal after diagnosis from Dr. Austria. the front desk then comes to me while I'm still in the chair stating it'll cost $1400 because ive reached the cap on my insurance. i told them i couldn't afford it, they then purpose a payment plan im thinking wow they really want to help me. Being desperate and scared I signed this inter-office agreement. the dentist per their chart, extirpated my canals. That's it. i tried to be ahead of the game and paid $300 toward the  treatment. But after looking around more and\nafter talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality (better work actually) the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn't make me feel like I'm scum.\nBethany dental front desk staff didn't help at all with the situation. after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly $800 for a supposed root canal (it would of been more if i hadn't blocked them from my bank) i actually received an email from them stating \"we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal\" I'm not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots. If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that, nothing else! \nBefore doing any kind of expensive procedure at Bethany Dental, don't me like me and rush into it, take an extra day and look elsewhere other wise they'll keep billing you for something they never even completed at outrageous costs.",

I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn't drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn't help at all so I don't know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn't like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don't care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.  It's obvious the workers don't want to be there.  Stay away from this store and Sprint",

I love their fried chicken liver and the manager told me that because they make each batch fresh that they are happy to take my order over the phone if I call ahead so that I don't have to wait at the restaurant for the 6 minutes or so that it takes to cook. I live just down the street and I have taken them up on this offer several times.

The tables are large and seat multiple parties together at each table, so it feels like you're at a party -- a party for awesome people. \n\nThe menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \n\nFor the entr√©e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however - it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon. \n\nDefinitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can't wait to come back to try more things on the menu.",

We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita's Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS'd ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the food did not disappoint!!\n\nFirst of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\n\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don't care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven.\n\nOur waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here.

        "text": "I used to love this place.  The food is very good, and thankfully that hasn't changed.  However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \n\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \n\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, the food is tasty, but I might boycott this place just for the principal of it.",

Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\n\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\n\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\n\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\n\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.",

NOTHING takes priority over my aerial class, (seriously, just ask my husband). I look forward to it every single week. The instructors are fantastic, supportive, funny, positive, motivating, and excellent at explaining the various skills. I gained strength very quickly, even going just once a week, but the biggest benefit I have found is that my 75-minute class is the ONLY time in my entire week that I can honestly say my mind is 100% in the present moment. When I'm at aerial practice I don't think about anything else in my life except exactly what I'm doing. I'm concentrating, getting a workout and laughing so hard every single class. It is the best therapy out there, I swear. The groups in each class are small enough to get lots of individual attention from the instructors, so you learn something new every time, and we all support and encourage one another as we're attempting new, challenging skills. I can't say enough positive things about this place...you just HAVE to try it!",

They serve shakes with a little alcohol.  Yes, a little alcohol.\n\nThe decor at Grub Burger is modern.  Sleek.  We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back.  \n\nDrew and I shared The Front Porch burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium-well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake.\n\nThe Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste.  They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck.    I loved the bun.\n\nThe Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw.  Also, there is very little alcohol.  i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead.\n\nThe onion rings lacked seasoning. Very bland.\n\nThey had other menu items that is different from other burger joints like Burgers That Don't Moo, crawfish pistolettes and they have an array of signature drinks. \n\nOverall, I'll be back and would recommend this restaurant.",

We ordered two never ending bowl, one with chicken (highly over priced at $4). Had two refills.  On all dishes there was very little sauce.  The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and 5 small mushroom pieces (nothing like the advertisements).

This went on for the rest of the time we were here. After 20 minutes of having our food the 3 of us were given one cracker. The crab was ice cold. The staff then avoided our table.

What can i say.\nThough it is part of a chain, i really couldn't quite feel the typical HOB vibe.\nThe food was average and uneventful. \nThe semi private concert i attended was great and that raised the star level to 2.\nThey could use some more people who enjoy working there. I couldn't feel the pride nor the funny bone that usually is part of the HOB team.\nI know there is room for improvement and i know the management has the costumers satisfaction as a priority.  That is why i am sure that they will make it their mission to review all the constructive criticism and make the proper adjustments.",

        "text": "Wow. Thank you, Yelp.\nI am SO glad I found this place tonight. It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston\/Allston area.\nFor about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. \n\nSo I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.\n\nAND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.",

When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \n\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \n\nThere are some things that were still delicious. I love the waffles still. And the focaccia is great. But for the high expectations that arise from the price, hype and 45 minute wait each time, Cafe Medina is absolutely awful.",

As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It's a staple and its prepared perfectly. \n\nA few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.\n\nThe drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.",

This was  an excellent decision (and no larks were harmed in the process).\n\nThe restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th.  The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food.\n\nWe had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer.  They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.  \n\nI'd reccomend this place to anyone who's never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable price.",

They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) \n\nBoston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can. \n\nAlso the staff deserves a shout-out.

        "text": "Point #1 - Haggle Free?\n\nNow if you know anything about the East Coast, you know that EVERYTHING gets haggled and negotiated.  I have this down to a science.  I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here].  Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable.  \n\nI pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE.  Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff.  Take it down.  Do it NOW.  I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy..  Winning is what fuels me. \n\nInstead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.\n\nConclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.\n\n\nPoint #2 - Prices are insane??\n\nOnce upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!\n\nNow buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\n\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \n\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \n\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\n\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits\/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \n\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...",

I am a long time lover and consumer of Tiff's Treats. This location happens to be closest to my house and my work so it is the most convenient one for me which means it's probably the only one I've been too. \n\nThe negatives: if you're visiting in person, the parking is abysmal. Prepare to walk from the next parking lot over, but after some fatty cookie or brownie deliciousness that may not be the worst thing. I have visited this location on many many occasions and I have never seen one employee behind the counter waiting to great customers. 99% of their business is probably delivery but every time they are in the back talking completely unaware that you have walked in and can hear them.\n\nThe positives: The chocolate chip, the sugar, and the snickerdoodle obviously! Outside of their very few and easily fixed negatives, Tiff's Treats cannot be beat when it comes to warm cookies on demand. They even have milk and ice cream to go with it if you so desire.",

Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor.  \n\nThe reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the service.  It was remarkable.  The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded.  The manager also came over to apologize.

Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \n\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target\/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\n\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself. They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day!!",

The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\n\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\n\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\n\nSeeing his site (http:\/\/www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\n\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\n\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.",

        "text": "I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\n\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket.",

        "text": "Neil England is a true \"Ink God\". I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \n\nLet's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997\/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \n\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn't be done,  until Neil came along....\n\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \n\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \n\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \n\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\n\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\n\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\n\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it's the work of NEIL ENGLAND,  that I wear with pride...thanks Neil....",

It's a beautiful place and I can't imagine the countless hours spent putting the videos together through real flight time. That being said it is absolutely not worth the money. Unless you can't make it anywhere else in Vancouver I would skip this and visit some of the actual land, air and sea tours around Vancouver.

All these one star reviews had me worried, but not as worried as I was about getting my husband some help ASAP. \n\nWhen we got in they told us they could see him right away, but if it wasn't an emergency he'd be sent outside to wait for a while. It didn't take long for them to realize it was an emergency. And from that moment on he was treated with the best care. The nurses were all really sweet and had great bedside manner, distracting my husband while giving him an injection, and one even brought us a snack (we had planned to eat breakfast at the airport). The front desk guy, who was struggling with our health care information, was nice as he could be about it. And the doctor was better than most primary care physicians I've had -- very patient, forthcoming with all information, and seemed genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. \n\nWe left with a less-dying husband, feeling perfectly cared for, and with TWO doctors notes that will help us get a refund on our missed flights. \n\nThanks, team! Hopefully we'll never need to see you again, but if we get sick on the way to the airport again, we know where to go!",

This place is just raw art that anyone can contribute to.  Bring your spraypaint and mark your place in history.

Just like all the other spots in Austin, this is prime location for building other types of establishments.\n\nI love that there are no frills here.  If you want to take a picture and get as close to the wall as possible, you will have to walk through some dirt,  climb up some broken concrete, and cross over some bums, homeless people, or freelance hipster artists trying to make a name for themselves.  Just do it, its worth it.  I wish i did.  But I was peer pressured by my friends to hurry up and take my selfie.\n\nI would love to come back and climb that wall all the way to the top.

You can keep eating for hours if you want, and they just keep on refilling your broth and items if you ask them for it.  They don't exactly offer to bring you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off sheet. \n\nWe had the chef's special broth and it was extremely bland, but the dipping sauce (satay and soy based) was not too bad.  I would try a different broth with a little more flavor next time.\n\nWe had a ton of stuff, but our favorites were the kobe beef, the scallion dumplings, the taro root, the salmon, and the absolutely delicious crab legs- we got two orders!!  \n\nReally you can't go wrong here- unless you are bothered by the slightly fishy smell when you first walk in.  But you get used to it!  For $20.00 this is about the best deal in China Town.",

Also, we asked property manager before we drilled those holes and he never once mentioned that it should be \"nail size\" or we will be charged for the repair. As a matter of fact, lease says that riversedge maintainence willl remove the toggle bolts - do nails need toggle bolts?\n\nThese costs are minor compared to the rent we paid and as I mentioned before it's not a deal breaker but it should have been mentioned in the lease or clearly told before hand.

I got my cupcakes to go and I was immediately enamored with the boxes and packaging.  However when i got home and actually tried the cupcakes I was sorely disappointed.  The cake was dry- really, really dry.  Stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper dry.  The frosting, by contrast was sweet- really, really sweet.  Cloyingly sweet- really quite unpleasant.  I ended up throwing 1\/2 of each away- it was really that bad.  \nI think they have a great concept that is very on trend, great packaging and store design, a great location and a customer base who will pay through the nose for a cupcake- but honestly... it isn't all about marketing!  You have to have cupcakes that actually taste good... or at least are not objectionably bad!  I am not sure how they are going to make it...

I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The broth at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn't exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory.  The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference.",

        "text": "This is my first yelp review because I have never felt this strongly about a business before. \n\nRegarding reliability and customer service, this is hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with.    Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \n\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \n\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \n\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\n\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  \nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \n\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.",

However, if you want a comfortable, clean, affordable place to rest your head, with speedy shuttle service and decent cafeteria food within walking distance, than this is your place! \n\nThe property is huge, so like the parks, be prepared to do a bit of walking! The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other. I also like the designated smoking areas which keep the cigarette smoke away from your room. My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \n\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \n\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria. I don't know if we were just starving when we got back from the parks, but the Chicken Parmesan was pretty outstanding. They also have overpriced beer in the coolers if you're feeling tense. ;)",

        "text": "I've always liked Flip (I've been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions - Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened  when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. \n\nThis past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating (two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1's mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the 'Haute Dog' made it. \n\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you're looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\n\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the 'Oaxaca' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there'd be. Always a plus!\n\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there's a muti flavor component to them as well. \n\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\n\nMy one tiny complaint\/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side - and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?",

Thanks goodness for the power outage last week! I convinced him to go here (\"like dim sum honey- only Spanish food...you know, like jamon???!!!\"). From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can't imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on. He chatted with us for awhile and it was most enjoyable.\nCannot wait to go back!\nPros: everything\nCons: need more friends so we can order more variety :)",

My old cleaner started out with one day turn around, then it became three, they lost things and ruined things.\n\nI found this new cleaner through Yelp friends. \n\nThey are fast, polite. They have coupons discount for first second and third time customers through their website. (though the website part through Qwest has been flaky) \n\nThey continue to delight me with their service: \"Do you have a substitute for the plastic bags covering the newly cleaned clothes?\" (they do). \"I lost some __, do you know where I can buy some in town?\" \"We have them, how many do you need?\" All above and beyond!\n\nThe traffic flow in the area is tricky, suggest approaching them from Broadway and PSU.\n\nGood service!",

All we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived.  At least they didn't put it on the bill this time.   I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM.  Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs.  And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent.  Not a good showing last night.  It will be a long time before we return, if we do return.   Great pizza can overcome poor service, but fair pizza and poor service?  That's a tough sell.",

The unlimited option was definitely the way to go.\n\nNow, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff comes right to your table ON A SWORD.  We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads (the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry.\n\nThe fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin.  There's a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible.  \n\nBe sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there's no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they'll keep serving you for as long as you'd like.\n\nA special bonus was the live music on Friday night -- a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player -- offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California.  Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven.\n\nThere's ample parking behind the restaurant and it's located conveniently in downtown Everett.\n\nThe value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I've paid four times as much for less of an experience.  I will definitely be back.",

I don't have another benchmark for Tibetan cuisine so my raking is based on the comparison to the other lunch staple in Central Square: the ubiquitous Indian buffets. I admit to a fanatical love of cilantro and it is featured in many of the dishes.\nThe dumplings are my fav(Tsel Momo, Langsha Momo), and I always start with those. I also like the noodle dishes(Chow Chow). The vegetables are always fresh and crisp(Tsel Tomma, Tsel Tofu). I would recommend this place for vegetarian meals alone, but the beef(Langsha Tsel Nesom), pork(Phaksha Solo) and chicken(Chhasha Curry) dishes are very good too. If you like nan try the breads.",

Jeff and Kevin showed up on time and did a one minute scan of our stuff, coming up with a mental plan for how to pack the truck in the most efficient way. They cleaned everything out in record time, and were flexible when we uncovered and threw some extra stuff at them at the last minute. The approach to our new apartment is challenging, with multiple sets of stairs and gravel to deal with. They handled these with ease. The trickiest part was our giant overstuffed leather couch which was actually bigger than the door or the stairway. Although they weren't 100% sure it would fit, they gave it a shot and through a series of clever maneuvers they got it up the stairs and into place. The best testament to their professionalism is that as they were headed back to the truck after spending 15 minutes muscling our couch up a pretty insane set of stairs, they weren't complaining, they were complimenting each other on a tough problem well solved. They obviously take pride in their work and we'll never use a different moving company again!",

Had an appt with another stylist, but she was running late so I was put with JEREMY. Thank you, God! He is AMAZING and I'm thrilled to get in on the beginning of what will be his amazing career. He is an ARTIST. I brought pictures in to show him what I was going for, talked about how my thick straight hair lays flat on my head like a dead raccoon in the hot\/humid summer, asked if he could please cut it (and show me how to style it) so that it doesn't do that. He did some amazing techniques (which my previous $90 stylist had never done), and my haircut is AMAZING. He explained everything, from how to blow dry to how to use the products to get the look I wanted. He was extremely professional, fun to talk to, and most importantly, extremely talented. He took his time to make my cut perfect (he says he's a little OCD, which I think is a good thing when it comes to haircuts) and while the cut took quite a while, it's PERFECT. My hair is adorable. I feel beautiful! Am going to take a picture today to post with this review.",

T\nhe salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado.

I was truly surprised and delighted. \nWhen I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.

Surprised, disappointed, and won't be returning. Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\n--------------------------\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom's closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I'm a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\n\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That's fine with me.\"\n\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office! And despite your upward creeping prices since, I have come back at least once a year because I loved the unpretentious atmosphere. I'm not sure what changed, but on principle I won't be supporting a business that lacks respect for their customers.\n\n1 star for this experience, +1 star for the memories.",

        "text": "I went to DryBar this past weekend to get my hair done for my 21st birthday. I had seen so many good reviews that I couldn't wait, especially since I am terrible at doing my own hair! The atmosphere immediately excited me- music, movies, laughter...I felt like I was at a club! The women working were so nice and my stylist was super friendly. I told her I wanted loose waves and she definitely did that. The reason for two stars, however, is that my hair looked great at the salon, but 25 minutes later all of my curls fell and my hair was straight. I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out. Paying almost $50 for a blowout that immediately fell down was really frustrating. Not sure if I would go back again!",

Until here. 2 pages of boozy drinks but not even the hint of what their non-booze offerings were. Maybe if we'd shown up with a kid or stroller, we'd have gotten the non-alcoholic offerings. I probably wouldn't have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the waiter hadn't been a little taken aback that we asked about them. \n\nNow, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done. We had 3 mediums and a medium-well in our group. I'd have kicked the review up to a 3 if they had cooked our stuff to order. There are plenty of M&E's in town who do things more consistently.",

By soaking myself in sushi goodness, I might forget that I have to pack still, have 10,000 emails that piled up during my 5 days of death by powerpoint.\n\nAnyway, the sushi here was tremendous. The edamame was HUGE but could have used a little more salt on the top and a little less on the bottom (suggesting that it sat f or a while?) but overall - the food here was fantastic.\n\nWe had a big party, split the tables and the other side had food coming all night long. We opted for a bit more conservative approach, ordering a big tray of about 5 rolls (including the Bostonian[?] - which was FANTASTIC). There really wasn't anything there that wasn't really quite delicious.\n\nTry the Kiss of Fire - but I have to warn you, there's a fuse on that fire. It hits you about your third piece in...\n\nThe service was great. We ran that poor girl's legs completely off. But again, order a Diet Coke and you'll get \"is Diet Pepsi ok?\". My typical response is, \"well, is paying in Chinese Yen ok?\"... you get the idea.\n\nAll in all, good friends, good times, good sushi. A solid 4.",

I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. \n\nI came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.\n\nI saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, \"that's what supply and demand is.\" And walked away.\n\nI would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.\n\nYour \"lesson\" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. \n\nI know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.\n\nSincerely,\nFormer Kreuger farms fan",

I came in with *orange* hair, trying to lift from years of boxed black (I know, I know) after having been told by more than one stylist that I had to settle. My experience with Michael confirmed that sometimes other stylists don't have the interest or investment in their craft to actually be the creative artist that they signed up to be. Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver. I also requested a challenging cut, going from kind of long blah to an \"a line\" bob which is also amazing. I am *really* happy with the outstanding, attentive service that I received and I am happy to have a stylist whose work I really love!",

They let us stay longer than the 2-hour time frame and only asked to rearrange us a bit.\n\nThey had a great assortment of pieces to paint - from practical to decorative.

But I've pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.  My beverage was a Matcha Latte (had to go to website to remember) it was ok, but for that \"interesting\" a drink it should have been more interesting.  Maybe it was the day we ordered.\n\nHmm,  I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing.  I don't know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn't like us :O\n\nService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.\n\nThe building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.

We ordered:\n\nSalmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\n\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.\n\nSushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.\n\nAssorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.\n\nWe were getting full by this point, so we didn't order the famed cr√®me brulee, so we'll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time.

        "text": "My roommate and I have lived here since 2014 and have had many of the same issues that many of the other reviewers have left. We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though. My roommate and I have learned to make the best of our living situation and I have hope that things will get better.",

A staff member came out and told her to stop singing and she simply replied, \"Ok ok I'll go to sleep.\" and left.

It's a huge upgrade to go from spending piles of money on flimsy cardboard boxes that you're just going to throw away as soon as you move to using super sturdy reusable plastic crates that get delivered to your door and picked up at your new place after your move! Your movers (or the friends helping you move) will thank you too because  the BungoBoxes have strong handles and included rollers that make them a breeze to move. Two weeks is the standard rental term and it worked perfectly for me... I scheduled it so I had more time to pack than to unpack and the boxes having a firm return date provided great motivation to get unpacked once I got to my new place. On top of it all, the BungoBox employees are amazingly nice and helpful. I recommend using BungoBox to everyone I know! Try it once and you'll be a convert too!",

Their bloody mary's in the morning go great with all of their brunch items: from the Simple Salad, to the Bordeaux Scramble and beyond. My husband goes crazy for the Croque Madame - he's had it at other places in Vegas and even Paris, and still feels they couldn't touch the one served here! \n\nAll of their salads, les frites, les moules au pistou, le saumon, I could go on and on. I've never been disappointed here - everything is absolutely delicious. Their daily specials are always a delight as well! Don't forget to try one of their cocktails or have a glass of wine off of their great list. \n\nBon appetit!",

After I went to Mohawk the first time a few weeks back (to watch Yann Tiersen play!) I haven't stopped raving about the place. It's my new favorite bar in Austin and it definitely exceeded my expectations. There're three decks outside, equipped with an outdoor bar to keep traffic from building up at the indoor bar, which is brilliant for show nights when it gets crowded.

        "text": "It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together.  Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\n\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.",

        "text": "After reading the reviews, I was worried to use this office. I almost called my doctor and asked her to switch me elsewhere. I am SO glad, however, that I decided to give this location a try. The office took me a bit to find (inaccurate navigation system), but once I noticed that the clinic was in the Westover Shopping Center, it was easy peasy. If you like *clean* parking lots, *clean* clinics, and *clean* enjoyable areas, I suggest giving this location a try. \n\nThe staff was kind and helpful, as well as willing to answer my quick questions about the bloodwork. I showed up as a walk-in and was in and out within 20 minutes. The phlebotomist who took my blood samples was professional, quick, accurate, and curteous. \n\nIn order to keep my wait time down (being a walk-in), I got there as close to opening as possible. From there, the 15-minute wait was no issue whatsoever. \n\nLastly, there's a Pharmaca in the same shopping center if you need to fill a prescription or would like to browse a decent selection of natural\/organic\/non-GMO\/etc. supplements and toiletries.",

        "text": "I came in to get my nails done for a trip I'm about to go on and what I wanted was simple--almond-shaped nails with a black dot on the beds + a clear coat. Very minimal. I got most of what I asked for, but upon a closer look my nails (which are naturally grown) were definitely not almond shaped. They're honestly only slightly different in shape than what I came in with. And as I was getting my nails filed by the first lady, she said that she usually charges $7 extra for filing almond-shaped nails, but because it was my first time she would waive the fee--which was nice of her, but I didn't know people charged extra for certain shapes! Or maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to nail salons (this was my first time going in about 7+ years). The other woman who gave me the manicure (not the same who shaped my nails) did an OK job. She was polite and friendly, and the coat was even. But the dots didn't all have a consistent size and one of them is totally crooked. But honestly, I could live with the lopsided dots. It's the shape I'm really disappointed about. I thought \"almond\" is a universal shape and thus that she knew what I meant--even after showing her a picture. \n\nThe plus side is that my mani only cost about $30 but it's still more than I would've paid for not getting the right shape. Maybe what I wanted was too simple. Or maybe they just didn't understand what I wanted. If I do come back (and it's likely that I won't, partially because of my experience and partially because I rarely get my nails done) I'll shape my own nails at home.",

Tilapia and avocado, an excellent taco even with with Quality Seafood's offerings looming just down the street.\n- The Pineapple Pork. Pork carnitas and pineapple with scallions, also pretty good.\n- The Kim Lee BBQ. Korean BBQ pork with kimchi and scallions, on 2 toasted Hawaiian sweet rolls. This was amazing, a perfect blend of sweetness from the rolls and savory from everything else. It was like the ultimate stoner food (not a bad consideration keeping in mind the neighborhood around it, especially considering that they apparently deliver nearby until 10pm most nights. Hmm....).\n\nMost tacos are $3.75, with the exception of the larger items like the Kim Lee, which is $5.75 and deserves every penny of its price tag. This trailer seems to prefer corn tortillas for the tacos, which is fine with me. Next time I'll probably check out the Mexican Bun Dog, which puts sausage and bacon on the Hawaiian sweet rolls, and sounds too good to pass up.",

Something to keep in mind is the geographic diversity of Nepal, it deserve a write up, that I my not be entirely ready for just now. \n\nTraditionally, Nepali food is less intense in terms of spices and sweetness.

Honestly, I believe this is where most Nepali restaurants fail to deliver. \n\nTibetan\/Himalayan,  Newari,  Indian\/Madeshi  alongwith regional fares (I would be hard press to express this entirely) is what makes Nepali food.

We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner....but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said \"well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes.\" We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren't in, so we ffigure that's why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she's going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else! We ended up taking our food in TO GO boxes and ate at work. Now we're telling our whole company of over 4,000 employees to stay away from it!",

I'm not sure if this location is a franchise or not, but it was just horrible. From the service to the food presentation to the taste, just ew! \n\nI always order a margarita, queso dip and a quesadilla explosion salad. Being that this is always my order, I've come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate (unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn't taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. \n\nI know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don't have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won't know, but we definitely won't be back here!

Thanks for the suggestions, everyone!\n\nOne of the first things I noticed upon perusing the beer selection is the availability of Real Ale Fireman's #4 in bottles.  Whoo hoo!  Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer...one of my Austin favs.  The beer variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle.  The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin\/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.  Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates.  Come to think of it, I didn't really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli.\n\nThere is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories.  Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks (I wish I would've known about this place when I bought mine) and candies.  Yum!  \n\nUnfortunately, but my liver probably thanks me, I was financially unable to purchase anything.  I will definately be back soon, perhaps even the day I get paid next!",

However, he is beyond overworked an on his day off the food quality suffers dramatically. The service is unprofessional and neglectful so you know how good the food must be because despite the large amount of cons the food that David (typically) constructs outweighs them. Hopefully the owner knows that whatever success she has achieved is because of this chef and she hangs on tight. However, for his sake I hope he flys where his talent can be surrounded with equal talents or at least basic professionalism.",

        "text": "I'd heard of Warby Parker and liked the frame options and price point, but I'd never seen one of their stores and I didn't think it would go so well to order glasses purely online. (OK, to tell you the truth it seemed like a hassle to be sent sample frames, send them back etc.) But while on vacation in Austin 2 weeks ago, I noticed this huge Warby Parker store downtown and figured it couldn't hurt to see if I could at least pick out frames there and then order online. Well, turns out it was MUCH easier than that; in fact, I never had to go online at all! I picked out beautiful trendy frames and a salesperson measured my face in about 5 seconds using this thing that looks like a simple cardboard box. When I told her that my prescription was pretty strong (around a -5.5), they said no problem. They took my optometrist's phone number, swiped my card, got my email address and -POOF- the next day I got an email saying they'd gotten my prescription from the optometrist. One week later, my gorgeous new glasses came in the mail! Please understand that I know what good glasses are and how they should fit. I've been in glasses forever and have bought just about every designer at one point or another. And these really are GREAT glasses. I was skeptical at best, I mean I'm used to spending 400-500 bucks on new glasses, and these were only 125. But they are made beautifully. And they fit PERFECTLY, and they don't even fog in the cold. I even went running in them this morning. So comfortable! I'm truly thrilled with the service I received at this store, their attention to the nuances of fit, and with the company in general. They make a wonderful product at a great price, and they're charitable to boot. What else can you ask for?!",

They have a very solid stock of the genre, and a VERY friendly and knowledgeable. Also the pricing hasn't seemed to all be eBay checked. \n\nThey also seem to stock the recent releases from most noise, art, and indy genres. Mostly Midheaven\/Revolver distro type stuff it seems.\n\nThe reason why this place makes my list though is that there is a small section of used stock up the stairs; as I'm not really looking for punk records most of the time. The selection is random as hell, but updated frequently. I have found some GREAT used things here (Barton Smith 1 & 2, Tree People, Amon Duul, etc..). \n\nOne of those spots that takes frequent stops to pay off, but it's got a great vibe to it.

        "text": "I find that there are things I like and don't like about this hotel. I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.\n\nThe food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\n\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\n\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\n\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here! I later learned that not all the rooms were like this, only on our wing.",

Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.\n\nMarvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.\n\nWhen she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.\n\nFor herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.\n\nThe portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.\n\nThe rest of us shared two ¬º Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter \/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.\n\nI liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!\n\nWe enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.\n\nThough we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.  They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils.\n\n3.5 stars, rounded up for their making amends.\n\nThey are open daily, and close at 8pm.",

        "text": "The only problem with Flip Burger Boutique is that Richard Blais isn't cooking your burger.  I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\n\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\n\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server\/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\n\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\n\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\n\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.",

        "text": "I was going to leeba for over two years. I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair . I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair. Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice! Unfortunately second time I didn't get message til after I went to salon. I am so hurt and disappointed by how I was treated by Elie. And I was totally ripped off.",

I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:\n\n- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)\nThis is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\n\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\n\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\n\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\n\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.",

If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17.  I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same.  In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing.  Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs).  They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado.  Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice.  I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there.  Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent.  So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant.  I really wanted our relationships last a little longer.",

        "text": "The only reason that the Empire Landmark gets 3-stars is because of the phenomenal view from our room.  If you can get a west facing, high story room then it's worth it.  \n\nThe only thing that could have improved that view is if they had had chairs out on the balcony.  It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  \n\nThe hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it. I feel bad for whoever our neighbors were.  \n\nThis hotel is also the only establishment we visited in Vancouver where I encountered irritated staff and sub par customer service.  Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  \n\nThe WiFi was slow but free.  \n\nDon't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.  It takes a solid hour for the restaurant to make its turn, so unless you want to spend $50 on drinks or milk one for an hour, just go up there and walk around it and you'll get the gist.  You have to be a paying customers to sit down.",

First of all, for $18, there wasn't much steak which was very disappointing.   I cant say if it was cooked to order or not since there was so little meat.   There were certainly more mushrooms and onions than meat.   Also, the bread was very crusty.   Too crusty.   The dish also came with french fries which were very greasy.  Only half were edible.  The rest seemed soaked in oil and were droopy.   \n\nOverall, not a great meal.   I certainly would not go back given the price.  I can think of a number of places that are much better.  Capital grill has an amazing steak sandwich (with two to three times as much meat) at the same price point.   OR go to Servitzios down the street for much less he money and a better sandwich.",

The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.\n\nThe biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.\n\nThe fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.\n\nI ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.  Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They'd be fair in any context, in any city, on any block.\n\nThis place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay.",

The shrimp were severely overcooked. The slaw was nothing more than shredded cabbage with dressing and some type of seeds in it. Not sure what they were but there was way too much and they had a bitter taste. I like my fish and chips to be thick and flakey. This was about 1\/4 inch thick and 3 inches wide. Might make a good sandwich if the breading had some seasoning, they weren't over cooked, and u layered them. Not even sure what fish I ended up with because they were out of so many items. I think it was the swai (catfish) and something else. If u plan on going, call ahead to see what they are out of. As other reviewers have noted, the fries were very good. I would come again JUST for the fries. Overall though, it was a disappointment. Not bad enough to complain about and send back, but almost. Sorry to be so harsh...",

Loved the look and California feel of inside being open to the \"patio\" area. Good all excellently prepared. Charcuterie plate was fun to explore. Yellow gazpacho was delicious although it's smoothness isn't what I know if as gazpacho. Duck entree perfectly cooked and tender. Swordfish great but the thick piece I was served seemed a little under done in center but outside edges not dry so understand the cost\/ benefit. Only downside: three entrees served simultaneously but fourth (beet\/ goat cheese ravioli) was 2-3 minutes later which allowed my accompaniments (delicious creamy polenta) to cool off to much. Delay was noticeable enough that a little mention\/apology would  have been nice. Definitely worth going to and would return.",

I thought it was an above average eggs benny, not the best I've ever had but not bad by any means. The potatoes that came with it were really well seasoned and crispy.\n\nI also shared the burger, which was really good and had Laurelhurst Market bacon, pickled zucchini, and heirloom tomatoes on it. The burger was good, but the bacon and veggies were what really made it. My only qualm was that the bun was way to big proportionally to the burger inside.\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty cool, it was kind of industrial with brick walls and in a partial basement. Service was good overall but I couldn't hear the server at all, I just kind of nodded through our entire interaction until I left.",

It was easy to see why.  They jumped on that Pinkberry-Menchi-Qoola-bandwagon and had their own version of fill and pay flavours.\n\nAfter sampling a bunch, I picked the pistachio, but I secretly wished I had a classic strawberry froyo.  I made the best of it, pistachio, a small squidge of coffee, mangoes, kiwi, strawberries and mochi balls and $7.80 later with an upstairs view of Robson street.  I was content.

I wouldn't think anything of it. But last nite. My life was changed.  This is the diriest crazy good. Keep talking about how good it is while you eat it. Wish you had more room cause u greedy and you want more good pizza !!! Are they slow? Its not so much slow as this pizza takes a while to cook. But nobody is really \"hustling \" in the joint. But man. Who cares...the pizza was worth it! Get some of the siracha candied bacon. Personally I feel like they should give you more for 2.99...but hey its tasty!!!",

        "text": "I decided to take my laptop to MacTronics based on a friends recommendation.  The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!  If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery.",

We both got mimosas, I got the migas (with a side of bacon) and she got the traditional eggs Benedict and gumpo soup for an appetizer. Everything was so tasty, even right down to the little cornbread they serve at the beginning. The waiters were extremely nice. In fact, we were about to forget our things we bought at Uncommon Objects and one of the waiters was quick to tell us we almost forget our bags! The wait was 45 minutes long but it was a Sunday on South Congress at 1:30 PM so it's understandable. The prices weren't bad and the portions were pretty big, so we'd definitely come back again.",

I like a place with character and as soon as you walk in provides a good vibe that is warm, inviting, and just the right size.  \n\nI love to start off my meal with the empanadas which are great.  I have tried them all, but my favorite is probably carne picante.  If you are looking for something light the mixed green salad is good too. As far and the main course goes my favorite dish hands down is the GNOCCHI QUARTET. It is AMAZING!!!  Order this and you will leave happier and full.  \n\nDefinitely check this place out if you haven't.  There are so many unique places in Austin and this is one of my favorites to go to.",

        "text": "I agree with a lot of what's already been written here. The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.\nHowever, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her \"magic card\", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.\nOverall I'm very happy with their work and the price so I'll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!",

I'm going to Artist Point again for dinner next month...I may see what I can do about taking some to go or finding out the recipe or something...I somehow need to find a way to have this besides my annual trip to Disney World. I can't believe no pictures of it are posted on yelp yet-posting one now. Anyways, I'ma big mushroom fan so I may be biased but I swear the seasoning with this soup...hands down...best---evahhhh!\n\nThe rest of my meal was fantastic but I just kept daydreaming about my portobello soup. When will I be able to eat it again? What's in it? How can I recreate that at home? Okay, anyways, on to the rest of my food! I had the Cedar Plank Roasted Wild King Salmon with spring vegetables, Citrus-Miso Buerre Blanc, and parsley oil. It came out perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. One of the best salmons I've ever put in my belly! I can't remember what dessert I had...but it was just meh. I'm a huge chocolate dessert fan and they didn't have anything super duper chocolatey the way I like it. The meal was pricey---so be prepared. We were on the Disney Dining Plan so didn't mind the money...it's 2 Table Service credits on the Dining Plan.\n\nService was excellent and it was smack dab in the middle of the Wilderness Lodge which is absolutely gorgeous! The decor reminded me very much of Frank Lloyd Wright with the lines & nature. I'm a huge FLW fan so I loved it! Take a stroll outside after dinner to watch the geyser and then hop on the boat back to Magic Kingdom!",

This comment is about the front-desk staff.\n\nI was very excited about their Groupon deal. So I called to schedule an appointment, telling them that I was using the Groupon. It was pretty difficult to make an appointment because I got one for two weeks later, and her attitude was not so pleasant. Then, she said she would email me a registration package soon. But I did not receive it until three days before the appointment. So I completed it and sent it back immediately. Later, she did not remind me about the appointment again. I had a very bad day before the appointment, so unfortunately I forgot about it.\n\nWhen I called to reschedule, I apologized several times, and her attitude was still not so pleasant. She said, \"You cannot reschedule until you pay us the $50 cancellation fee. It says that on the website. I don't know where, but you can go find it.\" You don't know where?! Because you never told me\/possibly anyone about it?! $50 was even more expensive than the Groupon deal I paid for!\n\nSo I said, \"When there is a cancellation policy, my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment.\" She said, \"Well, we do it two days before.\" No, she did not do that either. So I found another dentist. They told me about their cancellation policy the first time I called. Then, they called me to remind me two days before the appointment and two hours before the appointment.  \n\nMaybe being more responsible and courteous like the other dentist's staff would not have turned away your customer.",

I ate the entire thing. For dessert, we ordered the lava cake. It came with some ice cream and some dabs of sauces on the side. Our server was nice, but pretty slow. I had even heard a few people ask the blonde server to get their bill because they had no idea where their server was. \n\nNext time, we will skip the pop and stick to water.

Also liked they had some rolls out of the ordinary rather than the typical combos that you find at many places.\n\nA few notes having read some other reviews....One review talks about the fish being frozen, he must not know much about sushi fish as all sushi fish is frozen as a way to kill any parasites the fish might have.  \n\nSize,  the place is small.  There are only 7 seats at the sushi bar and one table.  On a Thruseday evening at 7:30 not a problem.   Additional options is you can order sushi at Roscoes bar next door.  Roscoes provides the liquor service for the Miyamoto sushi.  So if the place is full simply sit next door.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out.",

No really... you have to try one. Oh and let's not forget the fries, I ate them before I got down the street. I'll most def be back to try some other items on the menu (or get the turkey burger again). The customer service was great as well. They're super friendly!!!

I've changed my hairstyle several times and she consistently works magic on my head. From bringing in a picture to just needing a change but not knowing exactly what I want, she nails it every time. She did my hair and makeup for my wedding and I couldn't have been more pleased. I genuinely feel well taken care of at Ritual. Kellie has a creative eye and keeps my hairs lookin' fresh. Money well spent. Tip: Schedule your appointment late in the day, arrive early and sip some wine while you wait.",

The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.\n\nI also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.\n\nI tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good. The decor is pretty decent too, with some fun murals to look at. There is plenty of parking if you go around back, which is just a short walk away.",

        "text": "Update: I looked at the slip I kept in my car and the gentleman I dealt with directly is named Austin Slagle. Read this entire post to understand this update. \n\nI usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. \n\nOkay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. \n\nThey guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. \n\nHere's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. \"You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here.\" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. \n\nOh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon.",

I was almost shocked it was so good.  Definitely could be some of the best Indian in Travis County.\nWhy didn't they get five stars?  Tea service at the table was slow (my glass was empty more than full) and I did not like the dessert they had out.  Pretty picky, but I'm picky like that.  I need more tea!\nThe line for the buffet was constant too.  They have it up against a wall, and while there's an obvious flow, you feel slightly obliged to stand in line, waiting for everyone in front of you to shuffle through.

Several years later, while cruising down Lamar, I spot a simliarly named restaurant and my groupie hopes and dreams were answered, seeing as how I'd rediscovered my beloved restaurant. Now, they could be totally unrelated, but don't rain on my parade. \n\nThis place is a definite go to for delicious food. I've never had anything I didn't like, and the servers are always funny and chatty. If you're a fat kid at heart (like me) you'll enjoy their Bento boxes, which I lovingly refer to as a \"buffet in my lap.\" Chicken Terriyaki is good, portion could be a bit bigger, perhaps they just cook with skinny chickens. The Sumo roll is melt in your mouth delicious, and the BF is a fan of the Katsu Don.",

An hour later, after calling to make sure the drive is on their way, they tell me that the delivery man tried delivering our order and wasn't able to because the person who answered didn't order the food. To which I argued that no one came to our door, no one rang the doorbell or called my cellphone (WHICH THEY HAVE ON FILE FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE) to deliver the food I had ordered two hours ago. Also OBVIOUSLY if the person rejects the order, YOU'RE AT THE WRONG ADDRESS. The sales representative then changes her story and says the delivery man knocked on the door and no one answered at all. This is the second time this location has completely messed something up and the fact that there was no retribution for their mistake is astounding to me. Awful customer service, not worth a single ounce of effort. Also, use a new delivery service because a delivery man who can't do his ONE SINGLE job is absolutely useless.

My fiance is not much of a beer drinker, but was very happy to find a decent wine selection as well as domestics she could enjoy. We will definitely be going back, in fact we are leaving right now for live jazz (every sunday 2-4). CHEERS!",

        "text": "I have frequented this store fairly often since moving to Allston in September and even when I was living in Brookline. The owner is an older bald man- he runs the store with his equally bald son. I don't know about the son, but the owner is very knowledgable about his animals and really seems to care about them, though he runs his shop like a business as to be expected. The store is small and cramped and is often dirty, but this is to be expected at a small, independently owned pet shop. This man told me he has had this store for 40 years!\n\nWe talked about rabbits (I have a Holland Lop) and he told me about how he was taking care of a Holland Lop rabbit that someone had literally dumped on the sidewalk outside of his store. His dogs (including a giant friendly Newfoundland named Sammy) and a pair of black-and-white cats serve as greeters and mascots of the store.\n\nI personally was not affronted by the smell of the place. Yes, it smells, but when don't animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn't smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit's cage after a few days. The owner lets the parrots in the back of the store roam around sometimes and it's pretty dirty in that back room, so if you are willy nilly about those things, don't go back there.\n\nThe prices are a bit high here but I consider that the price of supporting a family business. \n\nTo address the claim of \"animal cruelty\" and \"unscrupulous breeding,\" I have never witnessed anything to say this. I will agree that a couple of the parrots have medical issues (there is one who likes to pull out some of his feathers), but I also know the owner often takes in rescued animals.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place. If you are looking for a spic-and-span, glossy-floored store like Petco, go to Petco.",

I've been to both the Chestnut Hill and now the Cambridge locations and both suffer from lack of freshness and a very artificial taste.  \n\nMost recently, I got a 6 pack of cupcakes to go at the Cambridge location which cost me a total of $19.15 (about $3.20 each).  When I got home, I realized cupcake carrier they use is not sufficient - the cupcakes are so tiny that they shifted around in the box and made a little bit of a mess (see photo).  The cupcakes weren't for any special presentation, just to satisfy my late night sweet tooth, so I didn't mind their appearance. \n\nBut I can not tolerate the staleness of the cupcakes and their very artificial taste - not when I'm paying $3.20 each for a cupcake about an inch and 1\/2 in diameter!!  I had a pink lemonade, rootbeer float, and a blueberry pie.  ALL TERRIBLE TASTING!   I don't even want the other 3 I purchased so they are going in the trash.  \n\nThe best cupcakes in Boston area is by far Georgetown cupcakes!   Their store traffic is so high you never run into staleness.  Their cupcakes also just have a rich quality with out tasing too artificial.  \n\nSave your money and avoid Sweet Bakery!!",

Another 20 minutes pass and no one shows up. I call the dealership and the receptionist was very kind and apologized many times and someone was out within 5min. I told the salesman I wasnt looking to buy today and that I wanted to look at my options. We took the car I wanted for a test drive and I absolutely loved it. The car felt planted, even on wet surfaces. The route the salesman took us on had l sorts of turns and speeds to get a feel of the car. We went inside and took down my information. He asked if I wanted to buy the car today. I repeated myself and told him I was only looking for today. He started getting aggressive and intimidating about making the sales.

I personally preferred the Betty because the fruit cut through the sugar, though the Harry makes for a better photoshoot with its little cauldron bowl. I don't know if I'm ready for donut burgers, but the desserts are an experience!",

You can go there and lift weights or run on a treadmill, but the real value lies in the totally old school atmosphere and the happiness such atmosphere affords. The walls are lined with old pictures of weight lifting dudes, the place is filled with regular joes in cut off sweat pants and the equipment is ancient.",

It was medium-bodied, smooth and lacked the awful, acid inducing heartburn found in $4 cups of Starbucks.  \n\n{However, one should expect brilliant coffee from George Howell, one of the most recognized and respected names in coffee.  He's the owner of Terroir (served at True Grounds) and former owner of the once adored Coffee Connection, which used to be sprinkled throughout the Boston area before Starbucks bought them out.} \n\nThis morning, a blueberry scone delighted the palette and made me wish I'd bought one more for later.  It was so good, it's hard to believe the English invented it.  \nOh, and to the calm, cheery people working the counter at 8 am, thanks so much.

Their pineapple is my favorite but they just Introduced Keylime which is also excellent. The variety of toppings is their strength but their product is a little expensive. For two cups of yogurt we never escape for under $15. When John Travolta whined about the cost of a shake in Pulp Fiction he was astonished to pay five dollars for an Ice cream drink.

Love the comic strip type art in the bathroom. \n\nOn to the food, we had a set menu with three courses, first course was tapa dishes, which we had about 7 of. My favorite was the ceviche although the octopus was a bit over cooked it was delicious , with the most perfectly cooked scallop to top it. Everything was tasty and unique. \n\nSecond course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. \n\nThird course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part.  We had creme br√ªl√©e, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! \n\nThis place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit!\n\nNow let me tell you also, we had a few friends at dinner who had food allergies, Barlata went above and beyond with separate menus which were also full of flavor and uniquely put together. It was great!So many times I've seen my friends get served plates of boiled veggies because of their allergies but they felt very included here. Nice job Barlata!",

I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity\/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \n\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't\/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right. So here I am looking for another shop.....",

This location is very convenient to where I work so I thought I would give them a try.  When I came in, I was greeted by Lawrence who was very friendly and told me he would call me as soon as he had a chance to look at them.  He called back around 30 min later to let me know both sets of brake pads needed to be replaced as well as the rotors on the back set.  Lawrence was willing to send me photos and  give me coupons to help with the price.  I would definitely bring my car here again for repairs and ask specifically for Lawrence.  I am glad I now have a go-to place that is also very convenient!",

Some just ride on their name but truly their quality is awful. \n\nWhat made Tanner Goods stand out is they are local. They have excellent service and gives advice for people like me who needs advice in how to keep my denim well. Yes, besides leather goods they also sell clothes. A bit spendy than most generic stores that you might go like Macy's, Target, Fred Meyer but they all pale in comparison when you'll compare the details of merchandise they have. \n\nSure, I could use a nice pencil. Mind you, they are cute but not for $10. But there are items like shirts, key fobs, coasters that are also well made and could fit your budget. \n\nThis is the place if you're looking to give me a gift. Don't worry, I accept gifts for any occasion. I don't need to have a local and US made product all the time but when I can, I do it right. And this is the place for some of it.",

I mean when our little ones don't want to eat the food, we know its bad... The place was just disgusting, the tables were dirty and the floors were sticky. Yuck.

        "text": "I was looking forward to shopping at Sprouts.  It opened a few weeks ago and I finally got there today.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  The staff is not just passive, but unpleasant. More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an \"excuse me\".  They had carts of merchandise stacked up, waiting to be shelved, blocking shoppers. The cashier situation was the worst. A customer in front of me had a return\/credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction.  I brought my own bags and bagged myself (as I prefer) but when all my items were rung up, the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags.  But the topper of the whole visit was that the cashier said nothing. No \"thank you\", no \"do you need a hand\", not even the now common \"there you go\".  \n\nThe place just opened! Haven't they trained the staff any customer service skills? I won't be going back.  \n\nAnd, the prices are not that great.  They have fake specials - 1 pound packages of strawberries @ 2 for $5 but a 2 pound package for $3.98. Similar with blueberries.  And many empty produce bag dispensers.  Management needs to wake up.",

        "text": "Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in...\n\nThe host greeted us, not by saying \"welcome to BJs,\" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. \n\nThe place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar\/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.\n\nWell--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. \n\nI never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. \n\nInstead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.\n\nAnyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalape√±o burger, which came with fried jalape√±os. The burger had only a couple of jalape√±os, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.\n\n\nWhatever--this place just didn't do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant.",

Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. \n\nI went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a \"must go\" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)\n\nThey did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.\n\nOh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you don't care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!",

I went here with a Groupon and wanted to give this place a try, third place trying Cuban food outside of Miami, I hoped this place wouldn't disappoint me like the others. I went with a friend who also had Cuban food in Miami before and also had high expectations. As I walked in, I saw (and heard!) a big group of Cuban people having lunch there (if Cubans eat there, that's a good sign!). The people there were friendly and we got sat down right away. I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place. Close to what I would consider authentic from Miami. I will definitely come back because I am sure this is as authentic as it will ever get in a town with a very very small Cuban population.",

I'm back on again and really a fan of their new studio space, which they've been in since sometime last year (2011).\n\nPilates gives me a different kind of weight training experience and has helped me keep my volleyball skills sharp as I get older. It also helps to reduce my back twinges and reduce, more importantly, the size of my stomach.\n\nThey really do have some of the best instructors in the city and I've enjoyed everyone whose class I've taken. They know their stuff and really do a great job of pinpointing my individual issues and isolating the movements so I can't cheat my way through a workout by using my stronger shoulders as opposed to my weaker abs.\n\nIf anything, I feel a bit like an outlier because I'm one of the few guys who takes classes there (which could be a positive or negative for you). It would be nice if the changing room was more than just a camouflaged utility closet, but it's better than nothing, I guess.

Brookline is very nice and fancy and despite not having a parking lot, there was a good amount of street parking to spare. \n\nThe actually restaurant was small.  Very small. I was quite surprised how small it was really. But when everyone spread out to all the available tables, there was enough room for you to make your delicious sushi creations.\n\nThis is only an exception for this particular class, but because there was a party that reserved the time spot after our class. Our class ended up being extremely over booked. It says online that the maximum is about 12 people. I think we had about 23.\nSo this very small room because CRAMPED.\n\nI went with my boyfriend an another couple. And we had to wait a while to get to the bar in order to get out ingredients. Then we were stuck in a  spot behind the counter, in the corner without a knife to cut our sushi.\n\nThere were a lot of ingredients. Crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, salmon, smoked salmon, regular tuna. It was a lot to work with, which was a lot of fun. I don't know much about Sushi though, so I was always wondering 'will this taste good together??'  So I wish they gave out a paper wither what some sushi has in it to mimic. \n\nWe ended up making about 4 rolls each because we were the only people not able to cut our Sushi and eat it like all the others.\n\nThe teacher was VERY nice and funny and I'm not sure if it was his wife that was helping or not, but she was very nice and fun too. \n\nWe took the C1 beginner's class and in the beginning we were given a sheet on how to make the perfect rice, which was really helpful and answered a good amount of questions. \n\nAll in all. I'd really like to go back and take a more accelerated course and just hope that the class isn't over booked that time.",

My husband had ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the hot chicken plate. He also ordered the fries with no pickle. After we had sat down they brought my husband the fries and said he could have them on the house because they accidentally put pickle but they would be bringing out a new order without the pickle. In my opinion that was a very good move however the new backs they brought out had a hair in it and we ended up not eating it nor did we bother to bring it to the front. Why? Because by this time we had also received our main meals and those were so unsatisfactory is that we had some get up as not a good food place so no point to ask for new ones. My chicken plate was nothing but mush. The chicken was so thin or had been pounded so much that it had tears in the middle so really it was only a mangled piece of chicken covered in so much breading and sauce that it tasted like mushy meat when eating it. My husband's chicken sandwich suffered the same but also lacked an incredible amount of flavor. It was so Bland!\n\nI expected so much more from this place because of the reviews, however when we were there we could tell a lot of people had ordered the tofu sandwich. The few people that we saw eating the chicken sandwich had actually deconstructed it and ate it with fork and knife. I was incredibly unhappy with the quality of my meal I couldn't even finish it! I ended up leaving and going to chicken and gun and thoroughly enjoyed my meal there! I'm upset that we had to waste 30 plus dollars to find out that this place was just another fail of a good review location",

I had read and heard great reviews about the food and was disappointed when I tried the pork flatbread sandwich and the hand pulled flat noodles. \nThe flatbread sandwich was sub-par due to the fact that the pork was dry and bland while the bread was tasteless.\nThe noodles were good, but I did not get as much flavor as expected from the dish. Having tasted other Chinese places in Chinatown, I cannot get myself to give this place more than 2 stars. Furthermore, the atmosphere was fine but I wish it was better as there was no A\/C on a hot humid day, napkins were like tissues and the place only took cash.",

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. \n\nI would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.",

I spend most of my time on the Newton Road trailhead and have a few loops around there that I love to watch change with the seasons. \n\nConfession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \n\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \n\nAnyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them.",

I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite.\n\nAnd they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up.

        "text": "I am known for being overly wordy.... so let me say at the start that I am stressed out about keeping this review brief!  There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.\n\nSpeaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking \"different\" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.\n\nNot having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was \"for real.\"  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http:\/\/workingclassacupuncture.org\/?id=7\n\nAt this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  \n\nThe interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  \n\nWCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  \n\nWCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!",

They accommodated and gave us a room overlooking the savanna, near their farm.  What a great view!  Early in the morning it seemed like every animal on the property would flock here.  The resort itself is absolutely beautiful.  Each evening we would just wander around.  We ate at Sanaa and Boma.  Both were great, but after 2 nights, I was ready for some non-African food.  The only downside is that the resort is far from all the other resorts and parks (except Animal Kingdom) though taking the buses was convenient.",

Flavors weren't very distinguishable but tasty in their own right. It was really just as good as many other soft serve ice creams i have had and at only 50 calories a serving and no sugar, I was impressed. There was a fun toy ice cream stand for my daughter to play with and a chalk board wall with chalk for her to draw on.  All in all a great no guilt treat, especially for the summertime.

I relocated to Portland and found  Nicole, despite all the horrible reviews about this place; I decided to open a new a membership.\n I needed to relax and get a facial due to long hours working in a federal building 80 hours + so I scheduled an appointment and didn't get Nicole, I booked on the same day with a diff person - I went in excited, however this time not even minutes of my facial; the lady grabbed a hot towel and rubbed the make up off my skin so I stopped the facial and my face was burning , she was not gentle at all and my face turned red and she popped a zit with the towel while she was removing the cleansing solution. After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident , I was not given the number to their manager , while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin, cheeks , jaw line, upper lip, and forehead. Come on? Really, why would anyone use so much strength on a facial???? And these people are supposed to be TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. I've never had problems with Dermalogica products. I'm not coming back. As I'm writing this post my face is still burning - I went in at 8:30 pm and it's now 10:44 and I'm holding ice to my face because it feels like sun burn.\nUpdate: received a call from from the Lead she was helpful and left some items for me to pick up to fix the problem, I called the manager Darcy wanting to follow up with her as well and she had left me a voice message.  She was understanding at first and as soon as I told her I wanted to cancel my membership , instead of receiving CUSTOMER SERVICE, she had the audacity to remind me of a time I paid using my \"boyfriends credit card\", wow I'm so disgusted with this place - so irrelevant and uneducated response. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY here.",

They are pretty good about rotating flavors, but makes sure to keep the classics. They also do seasonal flavors which is really nice and during Christmas time introduced different flavors every week or so. I thought it was a nice touch to keep things different and add a little flare. It also kept me wanting to come back each time to try the new flavors! Toppings are also nice and fresh. The sizes are great, which I only point out after visiting another place and wishing I could cut the toppings in a quarter of their size. They also have a rewards program that gives you a few free ounces almost every other time you visit. It's worth looking into - the program even has an app!",

The store is a mess, cluttered, and I can never find what I am looking for. Today after an hour of shopping I finally found an item for my friends son's birthday. The item was labeled $26.99 on tje shelf. When I checked out my bill was $56.99. Money is not the option, however, when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product. I said no, and walked her to the shelf, where 3 more of the same item sat. While she checked on the correct price the line became 8 customers long. Only one checker was helping customers. At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf.  I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location. He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store.

However, if you watch the store flyer it actually has some pretty good sales (especially on coffee beans and seasonal fresh fruits).  \n\nThe store has a nice bulk bin selection for nuts, dried fruit, snacks, and candy.  I am addicted to the flax-infused corn chips.  As a gourmet store, you will find interesting goods and high-quality produce.\n\nThe deli and cheese counter offer a wide array of delicious goods.  Always make sure to ask for a sample taste before buying.  The staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nAnd for any potential shoplifters, be warned -- they do watch you.  On my last visit, the police were removing a cuffed offender from the store ;-)",

I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service.\n\nI hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. \n\nTried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! \n\nOverall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!",

All of the gays and lesbians come out and drink til they are merry on this perfect patio in midtown; but don't let that deter you if you are straight, it is an equal mix of people, believe me! The restaurant is gay owned and operated, and definitely is a staple of gay Atlanta, so it is well worth mentioning. The food is pretty good (depending on what you get), and the service is always stellar. Some of those waiters have an attitude on them, but you just gotta snap those queens in their place! But seriously, it is all in good fun; I have never had a bad experience!!\n\nThe beer is cheap, and all the martini's are $5. There is regularly trivia, and there is always some reason to stop by Joe's. During the warm months, it is very hard not to just say, \"why don't we meet at Joe's?\", because it is the place to be. Parking can be tricky, there is a very small parking lot, but there is usually a place down the street or across the road, for pay. This is definitely a place that you will want to check out, for it's chilled atmosphere, the welcoming flair, and well, the whole package! You are bound to see me there, as we love to go to Joe's!",

Service is spot on and super accommodating.The best part is that the pho comes out ridiculously fast. The broth is SO yummy and gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling in your tummy. Generous amount of tripe and meat!\n\nThe #14 bowl is massive. On most days I can share it with my roommate and still be full. On bad days (Saturday mornings), I can finish the #15, which is a big bowl in itself, but much smaller than the #14. My boyfriend finished the entire #14 bowl. If you have the appetite of a small bear like he does, I think coughing up an extra dollar for the extra big bowl is worth it.",

My only complain is the gnats.\n\nStayed here for 2 nights in room 3233 - 50's section. We switched over from Caribbean Beach Resort to save some money. I suggest not booking a water view room - you will get gnats outside of your room that will get into your room. Be prepared to swim through a swarm of gnats getting to your room. We had some in our showers and the corners of the ceilings. To remedy this we lowered the temperature of the room since they do not like warm temperatures. But gnats are mostly harmless so we decided to keep our room. Overall, the room was clean (bed was made every night, new towels, new toiletries).",

        "text": "It was my birthday so I wanted to do a date night with my husband. I am a child of the 80s and heard about this place and was eager to try it out.\nHubby and I arrived early, after reading reviews about waiting for spots to play these retro arcade games. We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. \nThe place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130. Had a blast and couldn't stop ranting about it. \nThe only qualm I Had (which also reminded me of my youth) was the temperment of the Atari and ninetendo, having to fiddle with the games to get them to work...which wouldn't discourage me to return! It's the nature of these vintage machines. Thank you Joysticks for allowing me to relive my youth vicariously through your memorabilia, music, and all your retro touches. For my birthday I was brought back to a decade I enjoyed thoroughly!!",

Food was delivered piping hot. \nThe negative: service was exceptionally slow. Our server left a lot to be desired. It took her over 5 minutes to greet us and take our drink and appetizer order. Drinks came, and we were all ready to order, and indicated that to her. She just smiled  and walked away. Appetizer was delivered and still no order was taken. We had to wait an additional 5 minutes to eat our appetizer because she never even brought us napkins or silverware. We had to flag down a different server and ask her to get our server so we could get utensils. \nWhen she finally brought them she took our food order. \nThen we waited...and waited.... and waited.... 45 minutes before our food arrived. The restaurant wasn't all that busy. Other tables that arrived after us actually finished eating before we even got our food!\nWe ate very fast as we had to be somewhere at a certain time. Paid our bill via the ziosk. She came to clear our plates and we asked for a to go box. We waited another 10 minutes for her to bring a to go box. We wound up being late for our activity due to slow service.\nAdvice: go there if you want got food and have a few hours to kill waiting for slow service",

Although this place is pricy, it brings back a piece of home where my family would sit around and pick at crab legs while we talked for hours.  \n\nWe've gotten numerous things over the past few times we've been here, but these stand out.  \n\nOld Bay Crawfish: 1  1\/2 lbs of whole crawfish seasoned w\/ old bay. served w\/ lemon $9.00 Not as flavorful as Boiling Crab, but still good.  I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish.  \n\nMixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w\/ drawn butter.  (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00.  This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge.  I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat.  The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley.  It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold.  It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone.  \n\nI've been there where they have offered us a great catch, a 20lb lobster or whatever giant monstrosity they happen to catch that day.  Never partook in them, but it's interesting to know that you can if you wanted to.",

        "text": "I accompanied my husband to Orlando for Cisco Live. We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a\/c not working so well, I didn't like the size\/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.\n\nShould I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w\/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.\n\nPeabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b\/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out. The parking structure is conveniently located a short walk from the hotel. It was faster and a bit cheaper to park this way.",

He was liked away where it was sunny and looked through the humus again, then again. I was appalled that he had to comb through the dish so many times, when he cold have simply apologized and brought a new one. After 5 mins, the manager came to speak to us with all sorts of excuses. He started by saying that he berated all his staff in the kitchen, mentioned that no one in the it hen has long hair and that the brush they used to use would shed. He went on to elaborate that when a costumer found hair in the past, it was just brush hair and the costumer was being \"extra\". I didn't like the demeaning nature of this manager. I felt like he treated us like this because we were young because I'm pretty sure if we were older and looked different m, he wouldn't have all these excuses. \nWe ate our dinner, which was good and left.

Took your advice and found the great unassuming little restaurant in a strip center that was absolutely #fantastic.  The Chicken and Bacon Cheddar Waffles was perfect,  perfect moist fried chicken and the waffle was just great.  We also ordered the southern breakfast and again ---- just perfect.  I consider myself a grits snob and these did not disappoint.  Creamy, no clumps and when I cut those fried eggs in, #omg.  #justsayin. On my next trip to Atlanta I will definitely return.",

I finally gave in on a Friday night, and as I was the only one there I thought it would be the perfect time for somebody to rob me at gunpoint.\n\nI got the Spicy Pork Taco Box. It's a huge taco accompanied by lots of noshes including iceberg lettuce in orange dressing, spicy wings, a mystery egg thing and two mystery fried things. The taco was merely OK, the wings set my lips ablaze, and the mystery fried balls in mystery sauce were amazing. Sadly, there was no kimchi.\n\nThis is a better option than Taco Bell, but hardly a destination.",

In the end, I still wanted to dye my hair pearl white. Note that I have black, Korean hair about as dark as it gets. I ended up bleaching my hair three times before dying it and it looks amazing! This was done 2 weeks ago and it surprisingly still looks super good. My hair doesn't feel damaged and I get complements for it all the time. Oh, and the cut?

Once we got our drinks, the bartender walked around to the outside of the bar and sat down, not getting up the whole time to check and see if we needed anything, etc. I had to signal her over from across the bar to ask for our check. From there, it went further downhill...My legal name is William, but I everyone usually knows that Bill is short for or a nickname for William...like Joe for Joseph, or Bob for Robert, Dick for Richard, etc. Well, they wouldn't accept my Visa card because my license shows William and my cc shows Bill. In all my years, I have never had an issue of my card getting rejected...and I mean never!! I asked to speak with the manager and offered to even call my credit card company...this guy didn't have a clue, nor did he care one bit. I then pulled out my AMEX, which did have William listed, but the bartender then stated they don't even take AMEX. After all that, I just ended up paying cash, but this was in my mind terrible customer service! The place inside leaves a lot to be desired as well....small, unclean bathroom, etc. I would not recommend this place to anyone...there are much better places to go in that same vicinity.",

        "text": "The server told us they won the Best New Downtown Restaurant Of 2017. Some delicious, gourmet-portion dishes. \n\nTheir hospitality was disappointing as we made reservations the night before for 8pm on a Tuesday and when we arrived the female server said our table wasn't ready and if we left and came back in 20 minutes she'd be able to push 2 small tables for our group of 4. She didn't seem apologetic at all.\n\nA male staff member then handled a group of 5 Caucasians that were behind us in line. The one guy in the group said he had called in reservations about an hour ago. They got seated right away at a table right in front of us. Wondered why we didn't get that table.\n\nWe discussed the server's demeanor and whether to go elsewhere.\n\nThe server said they would call us once a table was free so we left for drinks at Yagger. We went back to Cinara and there were several tables available, yet no one had called us back.\n\nIn terms of food, standouts were the $8 Chicken Liver Parfait with cornichon, capers & garlic scapes, $17 Albacore Tuna Charred Broccoli, Black Olives & Smoked Tonnato, and $16 Beets, Foie Gras, Sunflower, Espelette & Red Wine Reduction.\n\n$33 Beef Short Rib, Farro, Toffee Shallots, Fiddleheads & Black garlic were a 4\/5.\n\n$23 Duck and Anchovy Ragu, Lemon and Parsley was good.\n\n$4 House Bread and Butter, $19 Mixed Salami Plate and $23 Tagliatelle, Bolognese was okay but no different than anywhere else.\n\n$24 Nettle Risotto, Pecorino & Shaved Almonds was a 3 out of 5.\n\nAgain, some tasty dishes but tiny portions. The noise was also slightly too loud to the point that you'd have to ask your neighbor to repeat themselves. We still had a great time despite the reservation issue and unthoughtful service. There were 2 dishes the server cleared without asking if we were done. They only had a bite or two on there but these are gourmet portions girl! That's like a third of the dish! \n\nBill for 4 people that were still hungry after was $292.50 before tip.",

        "text": "I'm on the fence with Teela Taqueria.  I've eaten in once and had take-out once.  Dining in one afternoon at 4pm I decided to sit at the bar with (as my lady friends put it) the Spanish version of Fabio.  He was nice, albeit rather slow and seemed to be new at his job.  I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.\n\nI opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  \n\nA note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.\n\nThe tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico\/onions\/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.\n\nUnfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings\/condiments didn't add up.  \n\nYes, I'll be back to try more tacos, maybe some beers after work.  And if you like oysters I overheard the woman next to me talk about $0.25 oysters available one day of the week (Tuesday, perhaps?).",

        "text": "Unos is actually my favorite restaurant and yet it's come to this--a two star review.  This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\n\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n\nMy whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble.",

If you want a sunset dinner or cocktails overlooking the lake, Soleil gets four stars.\n\nNow for the bad news. The food is only three stars. The menu sounds great with trendy options that would compete downtown. Unfortunately, what is delivered to the table falls a little short. I am normally very good at picking out flavors and appreciating unusual combinations, but there is a sweetness to many of the savory dishes that I can't place and just doesn't seem to belong. Sweet caesar salad? Sweetened bell peppers with hangar steak? Even sweet fingerling potatoes. It is not overwhelming by any means but just enough to leave my taste buds confused and off-balance.\n\nWith that said, the views and ambiance really are fantastic!

We were kind of bummed, but Tin Shed really brought our spirits up with their kindness, home-styled foods, and rustic vibes.\n\nIt was a cold night, and we were that annoying tourist family that requested to sit by the fireplace outdoors. They didn't have any indoor spots available. I loved the space. Our super sweet host told us that blankets were available should we need them--that's quality service in the ears of Californians. \n\nOur server was a tall down-to-earth boy who checked on us at the right times. We enjoyed some pints of local beer and literally licked clean all of our plates. Their food is veggie-friendly and there are options for everyone from burgers to salads. Tin Shed is also dog-friendly in the patio (and they offer dog desserts too!) and such a comfort-feel space. This place is a great place for family night or even for a chill date.",

Their version of chicken tikka masala needs some help but what do you expect when it is not an Indian restaurant.  The dumplings were amazing as well as the other more traditional Asian dishes.  The service was Disney quality.  Our son had fallen asleep just a minute before we got to the restaurant.  Instead of inconveniencing us by having us take him out of the stroller, they switched our tables so that we can leave him in the stroller and have him resting tableside while we enjoyed our meal.",

        "text": "I love this place. I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords\/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.\n\nWith Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.\n\nEvery single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.\n\nOn top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired.",

        "text": "Weekday lunch times are surprisingly quiet at NBC Sports Grill & Brew, at least in the two times that I've been here. They have two floors of seating, but the upstairs don't seem to be open for lunch. The food is pretty typical American fare. They try to make it a little more interesting with fusions of other cuisines, but in the end, it's all pretty standard.\n\nMy first meal here was the Bang-Bang Chicken. It was decent, but they doused the entire plate with overly toasted coconut shavings. I had to try to pick them out because even if you love coconuts, this was overwhelming. If you order this dish, be sure to ask for the coconuts to be on the side. My second meal here was one of the flatbreads. It was very average - not terrible, but not the greatest either.\n\nThey have a decent beer selection, and even one (or more?) that is specially brewed for them. For folks who are into craft beer, you will have some options, but probably not the most ideal if you're in the snobbier side of the craft beer spectrum. They also tend to be overpriced, but typical for its location.\n\nOverall, not my first choice when it comes to the options at CityWalk, but not too bad either, especially if you're looking for standard American food while watching sports.",

My friends and I were here to order drinks and apps, simple bites like chips and such. Our beers were fine, they were what you'd  expect. However when our duo chips (salsa and queso) came out, we were less than satisfied. The queso tasted extremely burned. Like as if it it was stewed a little too long, burned on the bottom and therefore permeated that burnt taste throughout. We told our server about it who stated that a few others had also complained about it. I happened to also order a fried chicken taco that was also served with queso...that also tasted burnt. In the end, I was impressed by how the manager and server approached the situation. We received a complimentary round of drinks which is the reason and multiple apologies. Mistakes happen, so it's how they handled the situation as to why my friends and I will be returning.",

        "text": "I love ramen like a fat kid loves cake. I consider myself to be a ramen connoisseur of sorts. As far as flavor goes, Sapporo ramen is in the big leagues. The noodle consistency is great and the broth is lava hot. There are a couple of things that bug though:\n\n1) Invariably, with pretty much any flavor ramen you order, but possibly more with the \"butter ramen,\" there is a 3mm layer of oil that sits right on top of all that fragrant broth. I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.\n\n2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1\/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.\n\n3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded. That means you will have to share a table with someone, and this person or persons (it could be a whole family) will be sitting very very close to you. You will know about all their personal affairs by the time the meal is over.",

That was our experience at Olivio.\n\nThe food\/portions was very average and very expensive for the quality\/portion size. The bread\/olive oil was delicious, the bruschetta was passable (bread was delicious but the tomato topping was stone cold). Our main courses were barely hot, which was a big disappointment after waiting so long.\n\nThe waiter was overworked (having been a waiter, it is difficult work, and it wasn't his fault) but he made no attempt to communicate with us and was barely apologetic--and did not offer us a complimentary anything. I could see that the table next to us must have complained more vociferously, as they received a credit.\n\nWe understand that kitchens get backed up, but it's the responsibility of the restaurant to make it right. At the end of the evening, we attempted to talk with the manager, who made himself\/herself scarce. To spend $60 (for 3 people, including a kid's meal) for such an experience is, to say the least, disappointing and frustrating.\n\nI was here several years ago and now remember being underwhelmed at the food\/value, now we have more reasons not to return.",

        "text": "This place gets \"nice neighborhood restaurant\" just right, and has one of the top two or three shrimp and grits dishes I've had in Atlanta.  The warm, laid-back-but-elegant interior combines with a usually very gregarious crowd to form an easy to like environment.  \n\nThe menu is more free-spirited and personal compared to a typical southern themed New American style restaurant, a bit playful, like Ron is talking about stuff he salivates over through his menu.  There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce\/gravy\/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don't interest me much.  \n\nI've had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I've had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It's usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I've sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I've tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it's more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  \n\nThe beverage selection doesn't dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  \n\nService is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.  Rosebud is a good neighborhood restaurant and a viable options for all occasions.",

        "text": "Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12\/09\/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. \n\nWhen you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. \n\nThe menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. \n\nFrom charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). \n\nI also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) \n\nThe burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. \n\nThe hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. \n\nOverall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.",

        "text": "After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return. I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads\/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge\/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That's it, rant done.",

        "text": "Mattresses...we all need them, but it can really be a pain to shop for them; seems like the mattress business attracts some hucksters to it. Notice all those 50% sales at the mattress stores? Umm hmm.\n\n\nAnyhow, the old mattress had been caving in for quite a while and she finally started to share my opinion that it was time for as new one (I think when you have to climb out of the bed rather than off of it, it's past time). There is one specific brand\/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot. I had assumed that it was a national chain, but MW is in fact locally owned and the owner was in the store. They have a lot of mattresses in their showroom, all there to be tested out. \n\nRachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate. So we've got the price and set a delivery date for three weeks out at a particular time on Sunday, and the delivery guys arrive exactly on time, set up the new mattress with no drama, and take away the old mattress. Everything done exactly the way it was agreed to. Perfect.",

        "text": "OH MAN. Romers is the best. I love everything about it top to bottom.\n\nFirst, the decor is fab. You walk in and feel comfortable, but a bit classy. Its got the feel of a sports bar \/ pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. \n\nSecond, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. \n\nThird, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. \n\nfourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives\/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) \n\nThe burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\n\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \n\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!!\n\ngo Romer's!",

        "text": "I'm not a food trough kind of person, and prefer quality over quantity.  It seems to me Hometown has kicked the quality up a notch recently, making it an occasional go-to place when I'm in the mood for massive meat product.\n\nThere are several items I now like here.  The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \n\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \n\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\n\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.\n\nDinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.  Drink choices now include a guilty assortment of Icees with my favorite, cherry pomegranate.  It's surprisingly good for a childhood dessert beverage.\n\nIf you're in the mood to shovel decent meat in your face once in a while, give HomeTown Buffet a try again.  I'm glad I did.",

I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business, but this place came pretty close. I came in a few times, and each time, the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a **** that I was in his shop. On top of that, he didn't have some items that any shop should have (irrelevant now, but had no 26\" rim strip and had just 2 motley saddles).

I felt good the first time I walked in and saw a green-yellow themed decoration with a number of great quotations about life and laughter all over the place. We were greeted with a sample cup to taste all those wonderful flavors of frozen yogurt. There are so many flavors to choose. My favorite is Chocolate Cake a la Mode. They say they will change the flavor every week so it's a good reason to go back there again and again. The options for toppings were even more fabulous - ranging from chocolate fudge to chocolate chip pieces to fresh fruit. I totally love this place. Highly recommended!",

        "text": "I'll start out saying I do my research before going to restaurants I haven't tried before and I love the raw, honesty of reviewers. I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\n\nThe atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\n\nI loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \n\nThe owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\n\nI cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \n\nWe finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray! Our server was lovely and provided great suggestions. You really must try this restaurant and if you like intimacy, don't go on a weekend. It was awesome.",

All the attractions had hour and a half waits. \"But you can purchase an express pass to bypass the lines!\" Sorry, I don't like the idea of paying the theme park to get to the front of the line. Universal has good attractions, but it's like playing a freemium game once inside. They should take some cues from Disney on how to help guests see more attractions.\n\nThe scare zones did nothing for me. It was a bunch of high school kids and juggalos with crappy masks or makeup lunging at people. We couldn't tell who was part of the staff at times, because they barely had what you could consider a costume. Some of the scenes they had set up looked cool, though. It seemed most of the crowd was younger, too. We (30 year olds) felt a little too old for the event.\n\nThe best part of this was that Diagon Alley was EMPTY. We rode Escape from Gringott's twice in a row with no wait. All the shops which are normally shoulder-to-shoulder during the day had plenty of space to enjoy. We were able to ride almost every ride in the park twice with no wait before the crowds swarmed back in.\n\nIn short, worth it for the lack of crowds after 5 and before about 9, but lame Halloween gags targeted to teens and presented by teens.",

We live in Milwaukie so it was kinda a trek to get there. This particular experience was the worst and embarrassing because I talked up the place to my out of town guest. As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, \"we are closing in 30 minutes!\". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving.  We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich?  The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. \nI am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out.

We have 5 people in our party, when we placed the order for the guacamole, the server asked us since we have 5 people, do we want to have one more avocado for the guacamole. We were not aware of what that really mean, and we saw that he added one more avocado to the mix of the guacamole. Later on, we found out that the one extra avocado indeed cost us the full amount of additional order of the guacamole. We were charged for two guacamole when we are getting an order of guacamole with an extra avocado in the same container. If we were told that the extra avocado would cost us $12.00, we would go ahead to placed two separate order of the guacamole instead. In that case, we are really getting two guacamoles, and not one guacamole with an extra avocado.\n\nWhen we compare out guacamole to the \"single\" order of guacamole at the table next to use, they both looked about the same.\n\nThere is no way that extra avocado should cost $12.00, I am perfectly OK if they charged $6.00 extra for each additional avocado, but adding just one more avocado to the existing order would turn it into a double order, that would be too much.",

Everything went downhill from there.\nWe started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster. Both were tough and practically inedible, with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell. With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll (she approved of that at least) and I sat incredulous, I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over. I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager, who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert! We went back and forth for at least 5 minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill. Still furious when I think about this now. \nDo not waste your time at this location. The one in Boston proper may be better, but I'd say just go to Legal Seafood or, better yet, Atlantic Fish (both a block away from the Boston location).",

Their staff is overworked and it shows in how they interact with allied healthcare personnel and their patients. Walking into the ER feels more like walking into a room of juvenile high school students gossiping about one another and their patients. \n\nThe staff is extremely rude and I can say both from first hand experience and from discussing with other health care personnel that most of the staff cares more about getting patients out of the building as quickly as possible than educating or helping people. \n\nThis place is a product of profits over patients. They only want your money and want to make you a repeat customer. They run on a bare minimum staff (most of whom are, admittedly, underpaid- which may explain why they are all so unhappy) and are not able to meet the needs of Dekalb County. Several times a week the hospital is filled to capacity and they are unable to accept any more patients. \n\nDo yourself and the staff at DMC a favor. Go somewhere else.",

        "text": "I was really disappointed to say the least. I saw some really great Yelp reviews with some not so great ones, I went in with an open mind hoping to find a new spot for date night.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had wanted to try here for a while and finally we had the chance to come here on a Saturday night around 7pm. The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night.\n\nOur waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. \n\nShe later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.\n\nDinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check. \n\nThis place is a big let down. It's extremely overpriced for poor service, small portions of bland food and you spend way too long waiting for things.",

        "text": "This place is truly exceptional! \n\nMy big goofy pit bull managed to tear up her paws while out for a run and needed all four of them bandaged, and the staff here was just great with her. I imagine it must be pretty easy to find a good vet if you have an easy dog, but for owners like me with very particular pets, the demeanor and attitude of the staff is almost as important as their medical expertise, and the staff at Alpine is amazing. \n\nMy girl was rescued from dog fighting so she, understandably, has some quirks--she is extremely dog aggressive, is very uncomfortably with men, and is a mix of very strong and very tender. I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \n\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \n\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \n\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \n\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \n\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.",

But they don't live up to the $95 cost for 2 adults and 3 kids and 15 for slushies. It is our fault not grabbing the 10 coupons we later found in every guide.  \nPart one, the monster truck tour. We went on OX. \nCritique one, get a good guide for the trucks,  The jungle cruise at Dw is scripted fun.  This is not. bits of interesting stuff,(like dw pays them to take waste from animal kingdom) but not enough. \nCritique two, spend some upkeep money on the trucks.  They were quick to tell us each truck cost 100 k. What have they done since? Idea would be fix  the seats, (all were falling apart) add a speaker system for the driver, and maybe add a few fans for days its hot as the sun like it was this past Wednesday. Given it was a full tour, this could be done!\nCritique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. \nPart two in the store:\nfriendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day.  We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade.  Both were very good.  But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere.\n\nThe slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating.  This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place  with some attention to detail.  I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review.  That will keep this a half full review.",

        "text": "Not a fan. My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \n\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \n\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \n\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\n\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \n\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \n\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\n\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \n\nWe will not be back.",

I had never been here before but my friend recommended it as she lived in the area. The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. \n\nI really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age. I can't wait to go back. An awesome bubble tea gem!",

But it's also not TRYING to be any of those things. \n\nIt HAS a bar, but it's for local friends to chill, catch the evening news, and have a drink. It's not the spot you are going to find your new European Super Model Wife. But they don't claim that you will. The bar is not the main part of this restaurant. The bar is just there so that they have one. The reason to visit is for some good food and to be in a relaxing environment with friends. \n\nBetween my husband and I - we've tried almost everything on the menu, and so far, we can't complain. The French Onion soup is a good, solid standard. I'm told to try the meatloaf (but my husband is a poopie-head, because he knows I don't eat beef). My personal favs are the club sandwich (minus the pork products) and their crab cakes. They also have really good onion rings. \n\nAll in all -- thumbs up. Stop on by.",

The truth is the people who ordered after me got their drinks first, and one of them ordered the same drink. The cashier, who was in charge, I assumed, didn't feel sorry when I complained, and joked with the staffs who were making the tea in Mandarin. So I talked to her again in Mandarin, repeating what I said earlier in English, and she provoked me by telling her colleagues to ease and take their time to make my bubble tea. \nThe drink is ok. I could taste some taro in the milk tea so I could tell it wasn't just some flavored powder in it. But the service is the WORST.",

Several people on our neighborhood FB page recommended Peacefrog so I decided to give them a try. Called on NYE day and got a friendly scheduler who explained everything. The technician, Mike, arrived on time and worked quickly. He was aware of our cat and gave him a chance to hide before getting started. We had a pet stain that wouldn't come up and we weren't charged for the extra cleaning attempt. Carpet looks great and the whole thing (upstairs and stairs only) took about two hours, plus drying time. Good job! Definitely would use again.",

I wouldn't expect the people I saw in here to stay in any motel other than one that rents by the hour.  The food was actually pretty good.  Hot and a decent selection despite the size.  Number one problem is the inside.  Run down, dirty carpets, a young girl sweeping right next to me as I ate.  Number two, and probably the biggest reason to avoid is the clientele.  The absolute dregs of humanity.  If the guy talking very loudly in his phone didn't bother you, you could have picked from the idiot playing Pok√©mon as he went around the buffet.  Oh wait, when he wasn't playing, he was definitely not disciplining his child.  The little boy was screaming and yelling and he nor his wife did a thing.

Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps (NOT air bubbles), shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix, and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job.  To top it all off, a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass, which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating.\n\nI'm perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me.  I don't care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me, not other bogus reviews.  I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite - believe me, this happens more than one would think.  Quality work is a lost art apparently, since it appears that a competent job can't even be achieved the first time.\n\nIf you purchase a new car, appreciate quality and don't want to be severely disappointed at the tint installation ruining the complexion of the vehicle, do yourself a favor in advance and avoid this place.",

        "text": "Welp, I've now visited this place more than 20x in the last few years.   The plus is when one happens to magically choose the \"freshest\" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.\n\nOur consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.  There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories.",

It was a good thing we got there when we did, because around 20 minutes after we were seated the rather small wait turned into a real Charlie-Foxtrot. \n\nThere were 40 people lined up along the small front waiting area of the joint shooting daggers at those that were already sitting and enjoying their food. The looks were those of desperation and hunger, coupled with a few who looked like they were dragged there by their wives and girlfriends because it's new and cool and would rather have said screw it and headed to Neuvo Laredo just around the corner.\n\nThe Piegon got the Butcher's Cut and I got the Flip Burger; we split the Onion rings. The burgers were exceptional and I liked the fact that they were not too big (5.5 oz), because when I left I didn't feel like throwing up or taking a diabetic nap like I do when I eat at George's or the Vortex. \n\nWe actually had enough energy to head over to IKEA and pickup some picture frames. Speaking of IKEA, the join totally looks like it was furnished by the Swedish furniture giant. The white walls and modern red plastic chairs look like something from A Clockwork Orange. \n\nWe split the Nutella and burnt marshmellow shake, it was O.K, nothing to slap family members about.\n\nOverall the experience and burgers were good and we will certainly head back over to Howell Mill Rd to eat there again.",

On previous occasions it looked like it had just a few customers in there but today it was half full when I got in.  My timing was perfect as within 5 mins of my arrival, the rest of the place filled up with a wide assortment of folk\n\nI ordered the Tamago (Egg) Ra-men that's featured on the menu cover and requested the spicy version. I am not a ramen aficionado by any means but I have to say it was tres delicious. Extremely flavourful and raise the roof off the top of your mouth, not blow it off, spicy. !  In fact,  I'm going to go out on a limb and say I definitely now prefer Ramen with chicken base over the regular pork base.\n\nI was a tad thrown by the whole brown egg that came in the dish and at first thought it was still in the shell but it wasn't.  Biting into it and getting the partially soft yolk was a sublime moment. \n\nI am normally quite a big eater and found the regular portion size ample.  I left feeling pleasantly replete and not over full or bloated which would have made continuing my chores onmy bike very uncomfortable.  \n\nThe decor is beautiful in an understated way.  Could not stop myself rubber necking to get a good look at how the casual yet classy ambiance  had been accomplished with a subtle colour scheme and textures. \n\nWill definitely go back and was suitably impressed to take others with me",

Because up until my last visit there, which happened to be on a Friday morning, I have always enjoyed this restaurant. Their food is very good, and that is the only reason I have left them 2 stars. However, their hostess actually ignored me for a good 30 seconds when I walked in because she was playing 'read my lips' with someone across the room. As a customer, I found this to be disrespectful. Then she tried to seat us next to the kitchen- when I pointed to an available table on the other side of the room, she got pissy. At this point I was just embarrassed that this restaurant was going to be my guest's first impression of Austin. The drinks are overpriced and plain.

So flavorful and comforting. It's like if your mom made you a nice heaping bowl full of love. The beef chunks were plentiful and not full of tendons like most places. It just falls apart when you eat it. Price wise, the noodles costed about 9 dollars, pretty dang good for what you get. \n\nWe also ordered the beef rolls, basically the green onion pancake wrapped around some beef and hoisin sauce. Four in an order, and trust me, you will get full off of two. The green onion pancake was nice and flaky like green onion pancakes should be, so thumbs up to RiceBowl for nailing that. \n\nI'll be back, RiceBowl.

        "text": "My least favorite  of the vape shops i've been to. They carry a TON of juices, but i found them to be of poorer quality than many other brands i have tried. The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. \n\nAlso of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice\/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.\n\nI did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way. It completely messed my palette up for a day and the resin really stuck in my tank even when i used a neutralizer\/rinse and changed the coil (ive tried several brands\/flavors and never had that issue). I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.\n\nThe prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted\/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors. While the sheer amount of options was impressive, and the service was pretty good, the options themselves werent high quality. I give this place an a-ok rating because of the service\/space itself (they have a good selection of equipment too) but i will stick to other vape shops going forward.",

The entire tent is filled with long wooden tables and thus it was not a private setting. Atmosphere reminded me of being in a large, festive camping tent, but tinted brightly orange. The dish we wanted was to split the Lobster Mac and Cheese: \n-Portion: Large \n-Cheese: bit \"watery\", could be thicker \n-Lobster: Average portion \n-Was it worth $27 without adding table service? Probably not.\n\nBy the way, if you're looking for a classic Lobster roll, do NOT get it here. I saw several faces of disappointment when the waiter brought them out. These lobster rolls are definitely underwhelming and expensive! Head over across the street to James Hook for a $20 one that will at least overfill the bun.",

        "text": "I found this kiosk in the food court at Natick Mall.  I thought I would give it a try.  Here's how the experience went:  There were 2 people at the counter when I arrived.  One person placed an order and said she would be back.  She walked away.  The other person was not making a purchase.  There were 2 young men working behind the counter.  The young man at the counter engaged a conversation with the remaining non-customer for about 4 minutes, never acknowledging I was standing in front of him.  Two more people lined up behind me.  I asked if I could place an order.  The \"front man\" moves to the back and the other guy comes and says \"Sure.  Sorry, we're really busy.\"  I order cheeseburger fries.  The former \"front man\" puts a batch of already cooked fries in what appeared to be a convection or microwave\/convection oven for about 40 seconds.  He takes the fries out and places them in a paper cone, shakes them up with dill flavored salt, covers them with cheese product sauce, 3 small squirts of ketchup and one small squirt of mustard.  He hands me the room temperature, hard and (previously) overcooked potatoes.  I was conflicted about what to do with the fries.  They were totally unappealing and tasteless, yet I paid $6 for them!  I gave up half way through and tossed them in the trash as I left the mall.  Please don't waste your money.",

He made fun of my friend's drink choice and acted like it was a chore to serve us. It was incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling. When we got seated, the waitstaff was clearly overworked and had no interest in us as customers. We got the mussels and a quarter of the shells were empty. The rest were literally the smallest mussels I've ever eaten. Then it took 45 minutes for our entrees and that was only after speaking with the manager. Overall the customer experience was awful and I will never eat there or recommend there again. The food was even mediocre.",

        "text": "After my bad experience, the office manager called me and told me that they would not fix the carpet they messed up, despite saying they would on here and over the phone because of my yelp review. She actually said that. I'm no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn't been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. \n\nWhen I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.\n\nThen, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don't just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. \n\nWhen I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. \n\nSo now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog's \"200% Peace of Mind Promise,\" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *\"only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.\" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn't exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work.",

She has the best personality evar. She's seriously such a delight, without being fake. She's totally honest (even admitting her love of questionable 1980s musicians who shall remain nameless). \n\nShe's so fun and I'm thrilled to be able to get a rockin' lookin' do, while having a great time, too.

I would have brought it up, but the server was too busy talking to her friend to ever come back to check in on us.\n\nThe server was talking to her friend\/customer\/acquaintance the entire time even so much that she took my plate of food and threw it away without even asking if I wanted a to-go box - which I wanted to take home with me. When confronted, she asked me why I didn't say anything - then apologized and offered me more eggs to take home with me. Cooking up more eggs for me to take home just didn't make sense to me. She then offered me potatoes with salsa, when I just would have preferred for them to have done the right thing and comped my meal.. (I had eaten only a 1\/4 of my food.) ALL WHILE TALKING TO HER FRIEND at another table.\n\nShe was nice enough, though her behavior was extremely unprofessional.\n\nThis was my sixth visit and I will not eat here ever again.

I was actually surprised that Jessika picked this place, since she hates Chinese food. But this is different than what you might usually find. The dishes actually tasted more Taiwanese than anything else I've tried before. For a party of five, we had no wait on a Friday night! \n\nShe was quite fascinated with the background of the food in the introduction of the menu. For dishes, we had the Shogo Nurmtak (appetizer) , Chhasha Curry (chicken), Langsha Duluma (beef), Langsha Momo (steamed dumplings), Gonga Deyngo (pork fried rice). All the descriptions and other choices are in menu pages, so be sure to check that out! All in all, the food was very tasty and well seasoned. It is not greasy at all and not the kind of food that you would regret eating afterwards. Darn the Chinese for their unruly occupation!",

I took my wife here recently for her birthday.  I had salmon, one of their 5 version of it, in truffle sauce.  it came out almost like a fajita.  The onions and mushrooms had the nice fajita consitancy, and the salom, a fairly average piece of it, was placed on top.  The salmon alone was meh at best, but the mushroom sauce and the grilled onions and mushrooms definitely made the meal.  My wife got some opakapaka (which I later learned to some sort of Hawaiian snapper).  I tried a btie and it was one of the better wish fish preparations I have had.  I am a fan of red fish, but not too fond of white fish, however I would definitely eat it the way this was prepared.\n\nOverall a good place for a date.\n\nOn a side note in response to a couple of the reviews I read:  Seriously, who goes to a fancy (at least fancier) restaurant and expect a 24 oz. steak?  When you go to a place like this you aren't supposed to gorge yourself like a fat pig, save that for Claim Jumpers or Mexican.  You are paying for the ingredients, the preparation and the atmosphere.  If you're just looking for some ho-hum food made in a ho-hum manner in a ho-hum restaurant but in large quantities, please go to Denny's and stop soiling the reputation of decent places with your improper expectations.",

They've taken A LOT of stuff off, added huge unnecessary pictures to hide the fact that they have about 15 items now,  and increased their prices.\n\n new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement.  Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off.  When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread.  Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge.  \n\nWhen you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here.  Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, \"so, if you want to pay for it...\" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  \n\nA lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.\n\nThey are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.  Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere.",

I overheard a few of the waitresses talking saying they did not want to seat\/serve them because they felt like they probably wouldn't get a good tip because they were Mexicans.  The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.  This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire.  There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment,. I will be contacting corporate regarding this incident. No one should ever be treated that way no matter what color or nationality they are!!!",

        "text": "Quite a noisy establishment. Service is ok but certainly nothing beyond mediocre. There were hardly any vegan options which I found somewhat baffling since this restaurant is located in a very progressive area where many educated  and  health conscious individuals live. The waitress did try to accommodate me and they had 1 entree which is true vegan. But that's it, aside from salad and sorbet. Parking is fairly good. Staff is friendly but in a very robotic and scripted manner.\n\nAfter reading the owner's reply to my comment, I felt I needed to reply. I appreciate the courteous response. I do not agree that 1\/500 customers are vegan. That statistic is misguided. What source are you getting your information? Secondly , I was invited to your restaurant for dinner and had no choice.  Having said that I feel your establishment just was not the right fit for me . Thank you for being honest and best of luck.",

        "text": "This was my first time I visited one of the chain's restaurants.  Despite it being middle of the lunch hour the place was not packed, only two people in line in front of me.  The cashier was efficient though not very courteous.  I ordered the Classic 1\/3 pound Thick Burger (which similar to McDonalds' 1\/3 pounder is also made of Angus beef), small fries and a small drink.  I got a plastic number tag to place on my table.  \nThe washroom was not very dirty or stinky but it could have used a flush and a scrub.  My food arrived at my table after less than 5 minutes (it's nice that you don't have to wait by the cashier for your name or number to be called), but without my drink, so I had to go and get a cup from the cashier.  The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  \nThe hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  \nThe burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  \nThe place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  \nI did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  \nThere is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. \nThe front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.  This location might not be accessible to handicapped people.",

        "text": "The Buckle is what every clothing retail store should model themselves after. They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other \"teenager\/young adult premium wear\" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.\n\nThe quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. \n\nAlthough their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail.\n\nAs far as customer service\/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.\n\nWe quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!\n\nI also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between \"rise\", \"fit\", \"leg opening\", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size\/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want.",

        "text": "South Congress Cafe continues to impress me every single time I visit, which lately it has been quite often.  Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening's dining experience.  \n\nThe previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  \n\nWhenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word \"bliss\".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  \n\nIt was simply perfect.",

        "text": "I want to give them 4 stars, but the 4 and 5 star experiences I've had there are very specific.\n\nFirst, the good:\n1. Love their special lunch menu - salad or appetizer, choice of a few entrees or sandwiches, and then choose between a few different desserts for under $20. Always good. Never a bad lunch there.\n2. Despite the fact that it's not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.\n3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.\n4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren't too spicy. I don't even put dressing on it.\n5. Love sitting on their patio in the summer and then going to see a movie. Such a relaxing date.\n6. Took my mom there for Christmas Eve last year (get a reservation!) and we had a two hour meal. It was grand and the service was fabulous.\n\nNow, the meh:\n1. In the winter, when you can't sit outside, it's a bit crowded, dim, and loud. This is a common theme in my reviews. I'm not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it's not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.\n2. I can't drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great\n3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, \"I have to go there again soon!\"\n4. It is pricey. That seems to be the way of it with good Italian in Boulder. They are not worse or better than anywhere else.\n\nI go several times a year. I like it. The good is way good-er than the bad. It's just not amazingpants.",

The place presents itself as a casual dining experience, but the margarita I bought was $10 and some of the entrees were over $20 (not all, some).  \n\nThis isn't the best place to just drop in to, but if I were planning a nice night out then I'd probably come back.",

        "text": "I started looking for movers in early January and got kind of freaked out by how expensive, or shifty, or nonprofessional, or whatever that they all seemed to be.\n\nI called an old friend who had been in the moving business years ago and he said, \"You ever use Yelp?\" \"Duh,\" sez I. Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints.\n\nSo I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.\n\nI called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.\n\nI decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.\n\nYou get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)\n\nOn moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we'll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.\n\nAnd they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.\n\nThey took less than 2 1\/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.\n\nAt the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. \n\nThese guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.\n\nIt was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.\n\nThis move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.\n\nI could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly.",

The potato mash stuffing inside the dosa was so spicy the first time around that my toddler was red in the face.

My husband had a to go order of Biryani on both counts, the quantity is for 2 servings but its still over priced. We tried the chicken chettinadu with nan.

It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :\/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch.",

You can tell that all of the ingredients are high-quality, the recipes are tried-and-true, and the bakers are highly skilled.\n-I'm a tea drinker, and I am thrilled that Octane offers loose-leaf Rishi Tea.  Yay!\n-I'm not a coffee drinker, but my parents are, and they both very much enjoy the coffee at Octane.  They are extremely picky when it comes to coffee, so this is definitely a compliment. \n-In contrast to other reviewers, I've found the waitstaff to be perfectly pleasant and polite every time I've been there.  The male cashier with the gage earrings and the tattoos is particularly friendly and helpful.  Of course, I have only been here a handful of times, so who knows?\n-It's a neat loft space with high ceilings, plenty of light, and a rustic retro feel.\n-Although the patrons (and servers) largely appear to be \"hipsters,\" unlike other reviewers, I have never personally had an issue with any of them being judgey, impolite, or at all unpleasant during my visits to Octane.  That said, I've only been here a few times myself.\n\nCons:\n-The chairs (as other reviewers have mentioned) are small, hard, and singularly uncomfortable.  \n-Most of the tables wobble.\n-In the summertime, the shop is virtually un-airconditioned, with two tiny ceiling fans providing next-to-no air circulation.  This makes it particularly difficult to enjoy a hot tea, which is my preferred beverage, when I'm already sweltering.  I can only imagine how overheated the servers, cooks, and bakers must be hanging out over ovens and stoves in the back.  However, the temperature is fine during other seasons of the year.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Octane + the Little Tart Bakeshop  However, you may want to wait it out until slightly cooler months of the year to enjoy their delectable desserts and delicious drinks.  Although I've never had them myself, my family has told me that their sandwiches and quiches are also wonderful.  If possible, it would be great if the chairs, tables, and AC could be fixed, but otherwise this place is truly excellent, and the food & drinks are perfect.  Yum!",

BTB turned a blind eye when I put the moh's rocks glasses into my oversized bag so that we could continue the party back at our places. They also have delicious food here. The cobb salad and the black and blue wrap are phenomenal. \n\nThe ambiance sucks on the weekends. Would you like another blue button down shirt to go with your Bud Light, sir?

        "text": "I'm fairly new to motorcycling and my first bike was an older Ducati monster. Motocorsa helped me with parts and some long overdue servicing on the bike. One thing that I needed was a new set of tires and I noticed they had a sale on tires. The tires on my bike weren't a standard size and were not on sale. Regardless, Motocorsa special ordered me the tires and gave me the sale price anyway without having to ask. I was very thankful since I was already dumping a lot of money into the bike.\n\nFast forward to two weekends ago, my bike was unfortunately backed into while it was parked and the insurance company totaled it. I went into Motocrosa and Christian helped me look for a bike that fit my budget. He did an amazing job at helping me figure out what I wanted, since the old bike I had isn't made anymore. Christian really did a lot to look for a bike for me even though it is an incredibly busy time of year for the dealership and my budget was low. I didn't expect such great service since there wasn't a ton of money to be made from me but he did a great job! I ended up finding a bike from a private party. Christian was excited for me and didn't make me feel like I made a bad decision by not buying something from him. \n\nI had a great experience at Motocorsa and they definitely have my business in the future.

Thanks to traffic in this wonderful town, she arrived late to see some friends of mine, so we decided instead to enjoy our time in town and ended up here.\n\nNot in the mood for a full on dinner, plus the bankroll was a little thin, we hit the bar for appetizers and near privacy.  We sat at a little table by the window at the far (as in closest to the door) end of the bar.  For the longest time, read: most of the time, we were alone.  It was nice.  Very nice in fact.\n\nWe split the Queso Fundido and Ecuadorian Potato Cakes, not realizing there actually is a menu for those without the love of meat.  But it was near divine.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Especially for cheese with peppers and other fine additions.  I wanted to take it home and slather it all over... I mean it was wonderful.  Linda loved it as well.  Washed it down with a beer and life was good.\n\nService was, well, spotty.  I think maybe because we were far away, or that our order was pretty plain, the waitress kind of ignored us.  Not in a \"you're not good enough way\" but in a \"you don't even register on my radar\" sort of way.  And to be fair, the isolation was nice - I hate it when servers are over your shoulder every 30 seconds, it annoys me.\n\nI think next time we'll come back to hit true happy hour...maybe even dinner.  Time will tell.",

Each little room is a different vendor and you can feel their theme as soon as you lay eyes on the area. You can check a wide range of who stocks here on their website: http:\/\/adjectivesmarket.com\/category\/dealers\/\n\nThere are tons of employees walking around ready to assist when needed but not pushy in the least. They also take your items you are carrying and place it on the table in the front for you. Great way to keep your hands free and each section organized. The range of decor and fashion is really broad so there is truly something for everyone. Furniture, decor, clothes, jewelry, maps, lamps, shoes, wood, tin, glass, so much awesome stuff. \n\nMy favorite were the abundance of wall decor, broach art, wood furniture and old windows and so many owls! I saw so many various pieces for myself as well as fabulous gift ideas for all sorts of occasions. I purchased two things for myself on this visit as well as two gifts. \n\nSuper packed on the weekends but still fun to go, however, if you want much less of a crowd, hit it up during the week. \n\nTruly Amazing!",

I liked that when you walk in not only is there a retail section of glasses and other things but there is a bar where you can do tastings. Also a bakery section in the back. It had potential. \n\nWaited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. Our server was Heidi and she was nice. Not too attentive but very helpful. Ordered red sangria, friend got the sparkling wine flights and they were both OK. The sangria was too sugary.Nothing special which is crazy since they make their own wine and that's their thing. Maybe I'm just use to the bottle wines I like, who knows. Appetizer was Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. They delicious. The amount of chicken was not enough for three people but it came with onion crunches, chopped cabbage mix and delicious cucumbers. For dinner I ordered the flatbread and salad combination, Carne Asada flatbread and Caesar pesto salad. The salad was really really good. I didn't really taste much pesto but it was faintly in the background which added so much flavor. The flatbread was perfect. The bottom was crunchy and the meat was very tender. My friend ordered the wild mushroom and chicken risotto. The risotto was very tasty. Got to try the ooey gooey butter cake and it was so good. Ha everything was so good ! I would love to come back and try more things. The lobster bisque soup was calling my name.",

Austin Property Inspections did a terrible job inspecting the condo I just purchased. I had a friend who is also an inspector come look at the condo before the API official inspection. My friend's license is expired so he could not do the official report for me. My friend found several things that Samuel at API did not find, one of them requiring major electrical repair. At my friend's urging, I had an electrician come and access the house and it needed more than $800 worth of electrical work in repairs that API missed. Because API did not document the electrical problems, the seller refused to reimburse that cost. In addition, the refrigerator was not working properly and when I asked Gary at API about it, he told me they do not look at appliances like the refrigerator, that is not inluded in the inspection. I ended up having to buy a new refrigerator because of their neglect to let me know it did not work. So, the $400 I paid API  for the inspection was waste of money. When I asked Gary if he could at least refund me the cost of the inspection to help offset the many costs I incurred because of his company's neglect to find them, he ignored my request. Do not deal with these guys. I do not know how they have such high ratings in yelp but they are not a company to trust with such a large purchase.",

I, being a member of the latter team (read: clumsy), did not do well here. In my defense, it was my first time. \n\nA little background first. Personal shortcoming- I suck at chopsticks. I can play piano, paint fine detail, french braid hair, write in fancy scripts, yet somehow I haven't mastered the ability to grasp rice with two sticks. Eating here at Kaze was like every embarrassing chopstick failure I've ever had, but amped up to the Nth degree. Basically, I found myself trying to skewer what appeared to me to be raw cold cuts, cooking it in boiling broth, losing the coldcut in the broth 3 or 4 times, overcooking it while frantically trying to fish it out, and quickly shoving it into my mouth, with broth gracefully running down my ladylike chin. Awesome. The payoff, in terms of tastiness, was not comparable to the effort it required, IMHO.\n\nMy dining companion, who was attempting to explain protocol, was appalled. He had to remind me several times not to use the same utensil that I originally picked the raw cold cut up with. Okay, so I suck. I suck at chopsticks, I suck at Shabu Shabu, and I suck at life. \n\nTruth be told, I just wasn't into it. I don't see myself trying this again.\n\n*If you like this style though, I am told that this is one of the best Shabu spots in all of Boston!",

It was stuffed with bacon, carrots, and celery and served with grilled creamed corn, which was delicious. The polenta cake seemed out of place and did not really add to the dish other than a stomach filler.\nFor dessert, we tried the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream was icy and had chunks of salt in it, which I did not like. The cake was dense, a bit on the dry side, and kind of like a flattened brownie--I would not order it again.\nService was a little slow even though we were 1 of 2 tables for the majority of our meal.

I usually get the tofu teriyaki bowl, which consists of tofu (not deep fried which is HUGE in my book) brown rice, fresh veggies and a sweetish teriyaki sauce.   It's my go-to healthy option for lunch and it's consistently good every time.  \n\nToday I strayed form the norm and decided on the veggie burger and un-fries (insert eye roll here, un-fries?).  I must admit that the fries are tasty.  They barely made it back to the office.  They were a bit oilier than I thought baked fries should be but that just made them tastier I suppose.  The veggie burger was ok.  Nothing to scream about.  I got it with everything on it which made it messy on the scale of a double whopper.  It had a bit too much of everything on it and some sort of seasoned salt on the veggie burger itself that was unevenly applied causing me to get mouthfuls of saltiness.  That being said the lettuce and tomato were very fresh and the bun was whole wheat and soft.  I think if I had scaled back on the toppings and asked for no salt I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my burger I noticed some other people's food coming out of the kitchen.  The entrees and hot wraps looked good from where I was standing.\n\nSome posts here say that the place is pricey and I'll admit that it's no McDonalds.  No dollar menu.  However my veggie burger was about $5 and the fries were $1.79.  The burger was huge and the fries were a normal \"small fry\" portion.  Pricey for fast food?  Maybe but it's really on par with DTX prices for a decent meal.\n\nI think I'm going to stick with the U-Bowls and entrees from now on, but I'll be going back to UFood",

The combo comes with miso soup and a drink. The miso soup was standard, slightly more salty but these things vary day to day and I would rather have more salt than less.  The sushi arrived with 6 pieces of each roll on both sides of plate with an adequate amount of ginger and a not nearly enough amount of wasabi in the center.  The wasabi was decent.  I've had better, but I've had worse.  Of course I know it's not real wasabi blah blah blah.    The rolls were loose, contained more avocado than fish, and none were spicy.  At all.  They must have forgotten that part.  The tuna (usually red) and the salmon (usually orange) looked so much alike that even the waitress asked if I needed help telling them apart.   Service was friendly enough.  The dining room is clean and the music was some weird circus tunes. Nonetheless, I was pretty disappointed today. I should have gone to the HEB and bought their sushi to go.  You get fatter, more flavorful rolls for half the price.  Yeah, I said it.  I eat HEB sushi rolls.",

We usually stay for at least 3 hours, and I only spend around $27! For enough alcohol to get me tipsy and dinner, it's one of the best bargains in town!

        "text": "I had heard so much about this place working downtown in Bev, and had only been in for drinks, so my husband & I tried it. We ordered a bottle of champagne and calamari to start. The calamari came out looking delish, and we dug in. Only 3 small pieces in, we are both fishing around the plate of the hot pepper rings that came with it, looking for calamari, since it all looked the same and blended together. That was it. Three tiny bites and no more. I was really disappointed. On a seperate occassion, I complained to the chef about it and was promised a calamari plate on the house...come to find out he doesn't work there anymore : \\\n\nWe ended up sharing the GIANT seafood stuffed lobster that night as our entree, which was excellent. No complaints on that one, as it made up for the stingy app.\n\nThe service was alright. Our waitress didn't check up on us as much as we liked (or needed). And I must say, one of the bartenders has quite an attitude everytime I've been in. Not only with her co workers, but towards me and other patrons for absolutely no reason either.\n\nOverall, I like the dark setting and cozy feel of Mandrake, and I would probably go back for after work drinks, but definitely not for dinner.",

We saw our waiter three times - took our orders, brought our food, and when we requested the check. Some salad plates, including mine, were at the table when we were leaving. I did not get my water refilled.\n\nI ordered the eggplant parmesan, and it was rather tasty, but it was a 3\"x5\" slab on a plate with a light red sauce. No side pasta, no nice mozzarella topping. It looked like it went from the freezer to the plate. It tasted average.\n\nThe decor was beautiful (+1 star). It feels like you're a cast member of the Godfather, minus the bullets.\n\nWould not go here again, not even for a biz lunch. I would rather go to Vinny T's!\n\nThe manager (guy with the tie) even came over, and asked how everything was. I didn't have the heart to tell him he should fire whoever our waiter should have been.

Having a team of three guys tackle your disgusting car at once is excellent. One goes to town on shampooing and cleaning the floor mats. Another is busy vaccuuming out french fries from Wendy's, McDonald's, AND Burger King. The third is busy cleaning the dash, windshield, and other interior panels. The cleaning goes like clockwork, and usually, it's done in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe only downside is that if you choose to have the additional services done on your car, you may end up waiting for a bit of time. They service only one car at a time, and if they're busy, you're going to wait in line for them to get to your car, and that could end up being a long wait, depending on what the other people in front of you paid for.",

Kaze Shabu Shabu is on the edge of Chinatown and is in a distinct purple cube. A friend had gotten reservations for five of us on a weeknight though upon entering it didn't seem like they were needed. We sat at a booth which were comfortable though the backs of the chairs were thin (kids were sitting right in back of us and kept kicking the seats). The service was friendly though sometimes a little slow however the menu is quite extensive. I am use to just choosing from two or three broths but they had probably about three to four times that. Also they had a lot more beer and drinks to choose from but no smoothies. I settled on the tom yum broth ($3), seafood deluxe with udon ($18) and a hot tea. The tom yum was delicious but spicy and the seafood deluxe had a nice assortment from clams and squid to salmon and fish balls though I kept wondering if these were fresh (there was still some ice on the seafood). I was stuffed by the end and felt that the experience and price were reasonable so I think I would come back here again.",

It's a very clean and simple mall.\nA lot of the usual main stores you will find at any other malls. Food court is decent with the main mall foods. There are a few restaurants attached to the mall such as Outback Steakhouse and a newly opened Trago Mexican Restaurant. There's also a pet store in the mall where you can see or purchase puppies, kittens, bunnies, fish, etc. \nA big kids play area right near the main entrance. There's a library on the second floor. The Cinetopia is also inside the mall which was just newly added a few years ago. A new Gold's Gym will be opening where the old Nordstrom use to be. Good seating area around especially by the Starbucks and Teavana is a big open area. Pretty much all the major phone services has a kiosk here.\nDuring major holidays like Christmas, Santa Claus will be there to take pictures. \nBad thing about the mall is that there is no wifi throughout the entire mall. When they renovated the mall few years ago they took out the escalators\/elevator from the middle and now they are on both ends of the mall. I guess it's a good way to make people walk the entire mall to go up or down but sucks when you know where you want to go and have to walk farther than you have to. After school time you will see a lot of high schoolers who hang around here. \nIt's a good place to walk and window shop but the small size of the mall and lack of stores can limit your exploration.",

It is a truly magical experience and so refreshing. There are so many restaurants popping up all the time in Austin that are all style and zero substance and they could all take a note from Tyson Cole. I've never experienced service so excellent at a restaurant before. I strongly believe newbie restaurant owners should take field trips here to learn what's up. \nIt's the little things at Uchiko. You know the food is excellent and inspiring, that's a given, but it's really the service that makes them stand out for me. They go so out of their way to make you feel like a guest, not just a customer. Whether it's the bartenders throwing in a free app while you wait for your table or just the honest and knowledgeable recommendations from your waiter. \nEven though we pay easily $200+ when we come here, I never feel ripped off like I do at so many restaurants around town. It is an absolutely phenomenal experience that is honestly more akin to theatre than a typical restaurant experience. Uchiko is a truly special restaurant that deserves all the hype it gets.",

She took our order, didn't write anything down then came back and asked us what we ordered again. She brought 2 waters even though my boyfriend had asked for iced tea, about 15 minutes later brought our salads then came BACK and asked what we were waiting on so she could look out for it. Our 2 slices of pizza came another 15 minutes later like warm and not very flavorful. The couple behind us had to refill their own drinks and go searching for silver wear. After finishing our food and not being brought our check we went to the counter to pay, where the server had to wait for another woman to finish taking to-go orders and helping customers before she could get change for us.

The food was good, but at these prices, I shouldn't be leaving hungry.\n\nFood is the cheapest cost at a restaurant so there's no excuse to be so stingy.  The $23 tortellini had 8 tortellinis.  They call it a 'light summer dish'.  It's not like they are identifying themselves as tapas either.  It seems they serve very little food so you aren't so full that you don't order dessert.  But I think after having 3 appetizers and 2 main dishes and having so little food actually served, we were ready to get out of there and have an actual meal.\n\nAlso, the caesar salad, while a decent salad, was not what one would call caesar.  The croutons were rock hard.  It came with one (pickled!) anchovy, and the dressing seemed more olive oil and lemon juice and nothing else.  A light salad, but certainly not caesar.\n\nFood quality is excellent.  The room is excellent.  Staff is excellent.  But I shouldn't have to go to Shake Shack after spending $85 on dinner.

Being told you have to wait or there isn't a table when you walk up during dinner or brunch rush is not the restaurant's fault, it is yours.  We decided on a whim to come here, but called ahead and made a reservation for later that evening.  Yes, we had to wait 2 hours for that reservation, but because we called we were able to go shopping and do other things rather than sit and stare sourly at the host.\n\nAlso, I found the staff to be superbly pleasant and obviously dedicated to their work.  I watched the entire staff while there, as I had a view of the entire room, and it was like a dance.  They all help each other and watch out for each other and give a head's up or quick word to the table's waiter if it wasn't their table.  The manager walked the room three times while I was there and spoke to each guest at least once to ensure a pleasurable experience.  This was a level of service and cooperation rarely seen outside the five-star scene.\nIf you find attitude here, you brought it yourself, love.\n\nThe food is carefully crafted to bring out specific flavors and combinations that the chef has designed.  This is not Applebees.  This is carefully crafted food, and it may not all be to your taste.  But that is the theme and design of this restaurant.  Frankly, I f***ing love it.  No, not everything on the menu, but the concept.  I spoke with the staff throughout the meal, and they take care to buy local when possible and also sustainably raised\/harvest food when possible.  I like that in a restaurant, as that is how I eat at home.\n\nThe drinks were also crafted with as much care as the food.  And while pricey, it was worth every penny.  Don't come here on a budget, but it's not overly expensive either.  The value matches the pricing perfectly.",

I highly recommend the KFC combo! They use an entire chicken (~17 pieces) and you also get a pitcher of beer of your choice. They offer a couple of sauces (some to dip, some you can toss). Tip: you can ask them to toss half of it in one sauce and the other half plain or in another sauce! The chicken tossed in Korean sweet and spicy is my fav. They also give you a side dish of picked daikon radish. I wish they gave us more side dishes! It's free so I really can't complain. I've also tried their kimchi bulgogi fries and liked it! It's not the same as chilantro's but it's still very tasty. They have other dishes like the military pot which I've heard good things about. \n\nThe server is incredibly sweet. I always talk about him when I bring my friends to college roadhouse. I've been a couple of times already and always enjoy my experience here. They have karaoke rooms if you are interested in that. \n\nIf you haven't tried this place, deff check it out! They will be open on sundays from Nov 18 and on! So yay come get your KFC fix.",

        "text": "I've been going off again and on again to Pro X for almost a year now. I was originally going to the Boylston St location but switched to the High St location for convenience. Therapists at this location are incredibly knowledgeable. The staff here consists of mostly male therapists, except for my therapist Lisa (And Kelsey? Who might only be there part time not sure). I actually prefer a more male dominant clinic, as I find that the atmosphere can be more relaxed while still keeping a professional tone.\n\nI work as a professional ballroom dancer and came in for two injuries (knee and shoulder). Lisa has given me a program geared very specifically to my athletic ability. The skill sets and quality of physical therapists can range greatly. I've been to clinics where I've felt that I was not being challenged enough given the physical demands of my sport. Lisa has designed a program to optimize muscle rehabilitation with a concentration on exercises geared specifically to increase blood flow and nutrients to my knee and shoulder. \n\nAside from being a great therapist, I find that Lisa is able to give a genuine warmth and sense of concern for her patients.  While I've been to a number of very qualified male therapists, I find that they can sometimes lose their sense of human connection to the patient and I end up feeling like a cow in a factory line. \n\nIn Lisa I see a great ability to empathize with patients, often putting their needs before her own. No matter how busy she is, or how early or late the day she always greets me with a genuine smile and a welcoming tone. \n\nAlthough I find all the exercise technicians to be competent, I have found Kyle to be the most knowledgeable and personable. He, like Lisa has a genuine care and interests in the well being of patients and is always very confident in his delivery of information on exercises. \n\nEric acts as a mentor at the clinic, and has really been able to hone in on microscopic details in my rehabilitation that has helped to propel my recovery process. \n\nJess, the clinic manger runs the best clinic I have ever been to. The office, while small is neatly kept, towels are always new, rug always clean, and table always sanitized. He has an incredibly staff that demonstrates customer services at its finest.",

One of their many fascinating sections is their Local Interest\/Local History section, which typically includes numerous old books on the region.  Yesterday I found a 1903 book on the history of Vermont that was in excellent condition, very inexpensive, and had some pristinely printed & maintained historical & (at the time) contemporary maps of the area in it of a higher quality than many of today's maps.  I also personally especially like their cookbook section and, as a former library staff member, the way they have several sections that are interestingly categorized, like the one of creepy children's books. \n\nAs some other reviewers have already noted, the staff won't bother you when you first come in - which I too appreciate - but I have also found them to be very helpful when I DO have a question, which I also appreciate.",

Even though it is a cemetery it puts pretty much every public park I've been to to shame in terms of diversity and beauty and attention to detail in the living elements of the park. The stone monuments, many of which are gorgeous and worth visiting to see on their own, just end up adding to the experience, especially if you are able to disassociate them from their morbid significance.\n\nIt's America's oldest arboretum\/cemetery\/elysium, based off of the Pre Lachaise in Paris, though I honestly think it is more beautiful, perhaps because if feels more naturey  and pretty than I remember the Pre Lachaise being.\n\n175 acres of rolling hills, ponds, wildlife ranging from frogs, herons, to woodchucks, a tower where you can get a near perfect view of Boston, 700 different species are represented in the cemeteries 5,500 trees, all of the paths have horticulturaly themed names...what isn't there to love? If you are history minded, you can go and seek out the graves of some of the cemetery's more famous \"inhabitants\" such as Isabella Stewart Gardner, William Gray, Winslow Homer, or Mary Baker Eddy. The cemetery also offers guides describing the different trees, birds, wildlife, and plants you can encounter during your explorations of the grounds.\n\nIn the summer, nothing is more peaceful or tranquil than grabbing a book, my camera, a bottle of water, maybe a friend, and sitting next to one of the ponds, feeling the sun on my skin and listening to the frogs serenade each other.\n\nI feel like Mt. Auburn truly is a superb testament to the intertwined nature of both life and death and how the two constructs can, and must, exist in harmony with each other.",

We'd always go to Lee's Mandarin (Mt. Prospect, IL) for all HS graduations, birthdays and special occasions.  \n\nThat being said, I have always like Chinese food more so than Korean.  My brother Tony K. currently works at Lucky China so I thought I'd pay him and the restaurant a visit.  The restaurant is at the end of the strip mall and is cozy in size.  With the red\/black decor and dim lighting, this place is definitely a cute date spot.\n\nI had a craving for some Thai and noticed they had chicken pad thai on the menu.  Imagine that? A Thai dish at a Chinese restaurant.  It wasn't the best, but I dug it.\n\nThey also serve sushi there and had a sushi chef on hand to make you rolls on the spot.  My favorite was the \"Rock & Roll\" sushi roll.  Pretty tasty for being served at a Chinese joint.\n\nCheck this place out if you're in the area.  It's pretty good food and the price is just right for the quality of food you get.\n\nIt's a great place for take-out as well. :)",

People make a lot judgments.   Those who think they are the least judgmental are usually the most judgmental.  There are people in the world who seem to need to make negative judgments about others in order to feel better about themselves.  Don't worry if they think you are just the shallow and showoff type, just move on.  Don't try to analyze what happened or judge their shortcomings, just move on.  You could be so intelligent and thoughtful in a very intellectual person's eyes but totally superficial and stupid to another person.    Don't worry about any of that, you can't please the whole world.  Just be good to yourself.\n\nAll the sincere and good people in the world, where are you?

I called room service to let them know about it and first person  just \"apologized\", second person didn't even know why I was calling and offered to replace the salad, after I told the third person \"you should offer me a reimbursement for that salad\" then only she called the manager, and finally after 7 minutes between being on hold and getting too many \"I apologize\" followed by silence and \"are you there?\" she finally offered to remove the salad from the charge. Fitness center: you get charged to use it 15 dollars per stay, the fitness center is within the Spa which is on the first floor, to get there from the elevator you have to pass by a bar, a restaurant and gift stores, (imagine yourself on your gym outfit saying hello to colleagues attending the conference), which is very inconvenient as another fellow yelper mentioned.

I have done this race twice, so you really have no idea what to expect in terms of the weather. It might be cold or it might be freezing cold. Make sure you have compression pants for this race, you will thank me later. I cannot stress it enough, do not wear cotton clothing, as it does not wick away your sweat. You will be running 15K (9.3 miles) and as you run, you will be sweating and all that sweat will be absorbed by your clothing and wet and freezing cold weather will make you extremely sick... not a good combo. So wear polyester fibers... or better yet wearing cold gear... \n\nThis race is known for their goodie bags, hot chocolate, banana, melted chocolate, a bag of snacks and a very cool fleece jacket that you should not wear during the race.\n\nOverall, this is a fun race, something I would recommend at least once.\n\n[Review #491] (76th Review of 2017)",

I just wish I hadn't poured the dressing on. The dressing tasted very chemical. So I'm curious as to what was in the dress, because the rest of the veggies were crispy and fresh in the salad. I think I would have rather eaten without dressing than the one that was given. \n\nAnd those fries are good for you? I have to look into this more because I'm sorry they were delicious!! And I wasn't so medicated that I didn't know they were delicious. And fries are a red light food for me. I usually don't allow myself to have real fries because then the fry frenzy begins.\n\nBut these were flavorful and crispy. And they weren't piping hot by the time they made it to my hospital bed even. So, I would eat here again. Nice to have a healthier option that is quick and not to expensive.",

Only word I can use to describe our experience yesterday through this morning.\n\nWe got one of the huge suites as it was a special occasion and everything about its appointment, the staff service, all of it was first rate.\n\nWho doesn't need a TV that comes on in the bathroom mirror and has reflected screens in the shower? I mean, c'mon.\n\nThe palatial suite was about 1400 square feet so beyond luxurious for a couple and with those kind of doors that lock on both sides that connect to other rooms, it would be ideal for a group\/family gathering. My fiance had requested an assortment of pink roses in vases, and spread all over the suite, and it was amazing and gorgeous and so special. We don't drink so our \"welcome treat' was those special size Diet Cokes in tin cans and chocolate covered strawberries. \n\nValet parking was complimentary with this level room, and as we were on the Club Level, there was a lovely room with tons of seating, small tables, arm chairs, and such with meals\/drinks\/snacks through the day at almost all hours. The breakfast might be called \"continental\" but it was only a hair \"less than\" the spread downstairs. The fluffiest eggs (my absolute fave are well done hotel spread eggs), a ton of perfect fruit, Irish oatmeal, a coffee machine that makes every drink you could want, breakfast burritos....I could keep going since I love breakfast food so much!\n\nThe hotel was BUZZING with the football folks, another big event going on in a large ballroom, I'm sure what was just early holiday traffic, and everyone we encountered was pleasant, helpful and just lovely.\n\nI loved everything about my fiance's idea that yesterday should be a \"trial run\" of sorts for our wedding NEXT December 1 and the InterContinental was a super place to choose for the royal treatment.",

But we like sushi so we ate at the 8-seat sushi bar. Ordered the chef's special roll, \"made with the freshest ingredients\" which they said included lump crab and avocado. Except it was actually krab, which by no definition is \"fresh.\" It was late so the place had slowed down quite a bit from the early evening rush. So you'd think the wait staff had a little time to actually wait on you. Nope. Had to go find chop sticks. Had to wave down passing personnel to get drink refills. \nSecond restaurant we've eaten at during our 8-day stay here and again ... the wait staff. Maybe it was just our one wait person, who seemed angry to even be there. Because some of the others seemed cheery and capable from afar. \nI know you're saying 'It's a hotel restaurant in a tourist trap town, what do you expect?' I expect not to be misled by the menu.

Seriously, you would be better off finding a rando roommate of craigslist than you would living here. \n\nI lucked out and got pretty good roommates - this has not been true for many other people I have spoken with at this apartment complex. It's luck of the draw and the odds are not in your favor. A guy I know in the complex had a roommate threaten his life and the life of his dog, he had to tell management he was going to pursue legal action before they would move the man into another room. The replacement roommate didn't clean to the point where his room should've been declared a bio-hazard. Like seriously, the guy threw up all over the wall and floor then covered it with a blanket and went out of town for a week. \n\nThe main issue is if these people aren't your roommates, it means they're your neighbors. Mine are all people who barely know how to take care of themselves, let alone another living creature, but for some reason have all adopted puppies they're too immature to actually take care of. There's constantly dog feces everywhere, even on the stairs and cement walkways leading to your apartment. Sometimes, they just leave the dog outside, completely unsupervised even though complex policy is that they're required to be on a leash. I'm amazed none of the dogs have gotten hit by cars. \n\nThere's constantly garbage everywhere - there's was a pizza box with spaghetti in it that sat on the ground outside for 5 days. There's a tree off our balcony my neighbors like to throw trash into - at one point they were up to 3 pizza boxes, a pillow and a vodka bottle all stuck in this tree. The complex has people that come around and pick up some of it, but it's like they do the bare minimum and ignore the rest. \n\nBecause the neighbors are dirty and leave trash everywhere, there are constantly roach problems. No matter how much you clean or how many times you put in a work order for pest control (which frequently gets ignored) you will still have roaches. Forever. \n\nThey advertise \"gigabyte internet\" in every room, but it cuts out almost every week, so good luck with that. \n\nA significant problem is that the office only hires tenants so since the place is primarily occupied by idiot college students, the office is pretty much run by idiot college students. The few that actually try to do their job and aren't completely incompetent don't seem to have any power to actually accomplish anything and the rest are often either misinformed or flat out lying to you. My friend once had an issue with a staff member being incredibly rude to her so she tried to complain to someone - they told her to speak to the woman she needed to complain about. \n\nAll in all, this place in absolutely awful and you should not live here at all ever.",

I usually get the #17 or #20, depending on whether I want just steak or some brisket also. 5 minutes after ordering an immense tureen of tasty pho is deposited in front of me and I go to town. 15 minutes after that I'm a beached whale, a stranded walrus, a dog who got into a full bag of kibble. It's great stuff, and while I can't claim it's the best I've ever had in my whole entire life, it's certainly worthy of being considered for all their awards they brag about.\n\nI'm always disappointed when Vietnamese places don't do banh mi, and so despite the vast menu, much of which is quite good, I'll hold a grudge. But that pho is definitely worth coming for, maybe even worth paying full price for if it happens to be the 95% of the week that isn't 2 hours on a Wednesday night. Their lunch specials are also worth a look. They're either $7.25 or $7.50 and include scads of shrimp\/beef\/pork\/chicken dishes with white\/fried rice, soup, and an egg roll.

The add-ins are a bit meager and the egg was completely hard boiled.\n\nI also took half of mine to go (I have a tiny stomach), and the broth\/meat\/noodle mixture turned into this thoroughly solid gelatinous chunk overnight. It was so icky that I just threw it out.\n\nThe add-ins are really basic, the tables aren't especially clean, and you're under a lot of pressure to eat quickly and get out. Also - a big pet peeve is that it's cash only, but it's not posted ANYWHERE. Not on the website, not on the menu, not on the walls; really, I scoured the place. It seemed almost like a cash only when I walked in, but I didn't ask when I sat down, partly because there's one server and they were rushing around but also because usually, it's posted somewhere!\n\nI really think that Boston could use a top notch ramen place that really takes the time to make their noodles right (or at least source them better).

The management is not in the loop to resolve ongoing problems quickly. \n\nOriginal:\n\nThis is the Boston metro area's last best chance for a \"everyday-low-price\" style supermarket.  Market Basket is super busy on the weekends and specially the night before a holiday weekend.  It is not the place you should expect the cashiers to ever know you by name.  It is busy.  It is high volume.\n\nFor people lacking time to shop weekly fliers for bargains, Market Basket will be easiest on your wallet when buying most assorted foods.  It is a place to find 25 pound bags of jasmine Asian rice.  The regular price of fresh produce will often beat the sales price of other grocery stores.  Frequent bargain announcements blasted over the store PA system gives the place some personality.\n\nShoppers who hate long lines may want to shop elsewhere regardless of higher costs.  However, if you visit Market Basket during bad weather in the middle of the week, long lines can be avoided.",

It's touristy, I'm touristy and altogether we're this sloppy, touristy sandwich posing around Gastown. I am sorry for that and I understand your disdain: I live in LA and we get that touristy crapola all the time.\n\nBut,but...hear me out. Chill Winston wasn't that bad, in fact I didn't think it was touristy at all. Shout out goes to the cute Hostess rocking a shaved head and the curvy girl indulging cheap fashion spots around Vancouver; you made an LA girl feel at home.\n\nLook, the poutine was crazy good, all gooey and savory with a hint of Jack Daniels. The beer list, heavy with microbrews, were fantastic and Winston's Earl Grey Creme Brulee'? Say whattttt? My dining companions had the blueberry coffee cake which disappeared after a 5 minute trek to the bathroom. \n\nStop that, Winston. Delivering good food on a warm summer day. \n\nShame on you. \n\nLook, I know it may seem pretentious, but that vibe wasn't there at all. Our servers were on the ball, a mix of white apron crisp and urban cool, and no one caused any dramatic, touristy scenes.

        "text": "After staying away for about two years, I was pleasantly surprised on a recent return trip that at least some of the things that made this restaurant a favorite when it first opened had returned.  A brief history is important.  When the restaurant first opened, it had a variety of reasonably priced comfort food items on the menu.  (My favorite was the salmon with bowtie pasta and vodka sauce.)  And it had a really nice wine by the glass list. And, it played soft selections of Sinatra and other pieces of the kind you hear on the \"Singers and Standards\" channel on the cable.  A little later, they built out the back into a patio, and successfully screened it from the Kroger loading dock next door so that it made for a delightful outside experience on summer nights. (That grocery store closed long ago, so no more problems there.)  It was a perfect spot for the Brookhaven\/Club neighborhood around it.  Then two bad things happened, and then a third.  First, the restaurant got too full of itself and it's wine selection, and kept upping the wine selection until a glass of wine was in the $18 to $25 range -- really a non-starter for a restaurant that by that time had seats in the booths that were beginning to fail.  Then they changed chefs (I presume) because the food quality went down.  And later, worst of all, they changed the music to loud, contemporary vocals, which I find extremely annoying during dinner.  \n\nSo I stayed away, for several years.  Having just returned -- twice now in the past couple of months, I was pleased with the new menu that contains a nice variety of dishes.  The several I have tried have all been good.  And, equally important, they brought the prices of the wines by the glass back down to a reasonable level.  The music on the inside was still too loud and annoying for my taste, but fortunately on the patio it was quieter and very pleasant.  Welcome back, Terra Terroir.",

So instead of filling up on burger, you can have a couple different kinds and have a multi orgasmic mouth experience! Now don't get me wrong, you can also order any normal size burger here too... but then it's like any other place. Nah, go for the sliders!\n\nWhen my wife and I visited the other day we ordered The Hawthorn each, she got a Chicken one and I got a Philly. Now the hawthorn was great, weird combo of goat cheese and preserves. Mouth orgasm! Yum. Her chicken one was tastey, but not a good pairing with the hawthorns sweatness. Same with the philly. It was good, but not well paired. Next time we will either get sweet and sweet or savory only. We also shared the fries. I'm really picky about fries. I like them crispy, not soggy. I like them shoe string size and i like them hot. So these fries hit all of my req, they were perfect. Plus they were seasoned with garlic.\n\nI am a wheelchair user, and getting into this place is easy, flat and tables are large enough to accommodate me. Also the tables are tall enough to park under. The staff were knowledgeable about the products and pleasant to speak to.\n\nThis place does have beer on tap but I didn't try any. I will next time!",

        "text": "We were very excited. We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. \n\nSome of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise that's all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.\n\nThe ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue \"New England fishing scheme\" decor.\n\nBut we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didn't love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks\/conversation\/etc. exclusively to him (I'm female). And it didn't seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: we're here for the food. So....\n\nI love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if you're lucky). I'll certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.\n\nThe bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasn't fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, I've had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isn't a good sign that they know what they're doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and it's wasteful on the food costs. (We didn't really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)\n\nI love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more \"lobster pot pie\" than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.\n\nAs for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. \n\nWith the bisque being \"good,\" the salmon chowder being \"meh,\" the newberg being \"downright awful,\" and the roll being \"meh,\" nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there\/return\/be romantic\/eat more\/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere. (Psssst -- just go to Le Pigeon. Right now.)",

Kind of bummed since we had a ton of stuff to carry up, so we waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes. The room was nice enough, had a lot of desk type space and since we were sharing the room with another couple, that was nice. It had a fridge, that froze everything we put in it, and a speaker dock, that didn't work. There is a keurig to make coffee. No fan in the bathroom, which is not awesome when four people need to take showers and get ready. The bride was on the executive floor which was where we got ready and they have a little snack area set up with a cool coffee maker and pop\/juice free for the taking. The housekeeping staff was great. We had the do not disturb on our door and when the one lady saw me going, she stopped and asked if we needed anything for the room. She definitely went out of her way. The paper is also hanging on the door each morning, it was the Columbus Dispatch. Valet parking for $17\/night and you just text them when you need your car.

        "text": "Journeyman, I really wanted to like you. I tried so hard, considering the restaurant is literally 6 minutes from my house and thus my neighbor. I love Union Square and the refinement that Journeyman (purportedly) brings is definitely overdue. However... It just does not work. On paper, the restaurant is everything I love: local, modern, inventive, casual, but in reality, the restaurant seems to take itself too seriously. Despite the disappointing dining experience, I'm glad I went, I just won't be returning. \n\nThe hubs and I went to celebrate a wedding anniversary and opted for the five-course omnivore menu, added a serving of the foie gras, confit veal tongue and smoked beef heart. The five-course menu consisted of spring salad with favas, peas, spinach, carrots and had  \"spring foam\", that didn't seem to really serve a purpose; asparagus with soy and bonito; sous vide black cod with leek puree and potato; veal breast with sweetbreads and artichoke and a dessert of cane sugars, including macarons, shoofly pie and about twelve different things. As an amuse, we were offered a warm lentil salad, gruyere gougeres and house-cured ham. There was also a pre-dessert which was a flan with freshly grated nutmeg and post-dessert of poppyseed crackers with rhubarb jam and Florentines with house-made marshmallows. So all in all, we ended up having eleven different things to taste. If I were to order anything again, I'd ask for the cod and the sweetbreads, followed by the flan. Unfortunately, the rest just seemed discordant; the flavors weren't in harmony for me at all. Especially the asparagus dish was so bland, which was so surprising considering there were about 15 components on the plate! Each plate was pretty but the gels, foams and pearls can only get you so far when the flavors aren't up to \npar. \n\nThe drinks were wonderful, albeit tiny. For a $14 cocktail, I'd like more than 4oz. \n\nThe atmosphere was awkward to say the least. We did arrive on the early side, with a six o'clock reservation, but we immediately felt like intruders. There is no music, which automatically made us feel like we should whisper to each other. Space is so spare that some music would definitely compliment the industrial, even slightly clinical vibe. I just wanted the restaurant to feel fun and it is about much as fun as a hospital recovery room. \n\nThe service was... adorable. In the way that there is so much good-willed effort and so little actual success. I seriously thought that our server might explode with awkwardness. The stilted service made me giggly, which in turn seemed to worsen the awkwardness. Ah well. \nAll in all, our tab came to $270, which is kind of absurd, despite the fact that we had quite a few drinks - for half that, we could have had a much more substantial and meal at e.g. Island Creek Oyster bar, or Coppa. Not to mention we could have had a laugh.",

        "text": "I went to the Coolidge Corner location last Saturday morning for my first Brazilian wax. I read online what to do to prepare and did such. When I went in the front desk staff were very friendly and the waiting room looked clean. I was called back a few minutes later by the waxer (I forget her name) I think Kelsey. Once we went into the room I got undressed and she started wiping. I thought she was going to go through the process with me as I told her this was my first wax. She abruptly stopped, explained to me she had other clients booked after me and then said rudely what are your questions. After asking she did the first strip of wax which hurt more than anything in life I have experienced! I said can you give me a minute before the next one? She stated again that she did not have time to give me a break because she had other clients. After the second strip I screamed and said I did not want to continue this it was far too painful. She said I've been doing this for over 10years, my response was I'm sure you have but this is not for me. She told me I could get dressed and as I pointed out the wax that was still left on my vagina and my skin was BLEEDING! She gave me a tissue and walked out of the room. I got dressed after placing tissue on my areas of skin that were still bleeding and left. Waxing is not for me I found it to be way too painful however this waxer was extremely unprofessional. She was blonde. She looked like she had been on an all night prior party bender with her makeup from the previous night still on. She had on scrubs that were completely wrinkled. Inside the exam room the floor was filthy, I know it is winter but clients are getting undressed the floor should be clean. Again had the experience been nice I could still say this wasn't for me but I'd refer a friend here, hell no. It was dirty, the waxer was dirty looking and her attitude was stank! Also there was NO one in the waiting room as I left!",

Maybe because I'm still a kid at heart, but this place is COOL! \nYea the rooms are a little small, but for the price it definitely cannot be beat. \nDisney staff is so friendly and smiley and polite. They help you with any questions you have. The resort has THREE pools in funky shapes. Open pingpong table next to the pool. Tons of sunning chairs. Larger than life statues of classic favs from each decade; I stayed in one of the '60s buildings right next to the Hippy Dippy pool. The arcade inside the main building was jam packed, filled with  addictive games. And they give tickets that you can trade in for prizes. Free shuttle buses to ALL Disney parks + Downtown Disney makes life so much more convenient. and we got Magical Express for staying at a Disney resort aka a big bus picked us up from the airport, dropped us off at Pop, and our luggage was automatically delivered to our room for freeeeee.\n\nFood court has simple selections: burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. Overpriced, but not obscenely overpriced. The best part are the three stations for drink refills: basically unlimited soda, coffee, slurpees, hot chocolate if you have a Disney cup. \n\nThe notgreat part was the keycard demagnetization. It happened so often and it sucks. We would walk all the way back to our rooms to be denied access. Then have to walk back to the main building to get it remagnetized. At least the staff was quick and apologetic. Made us feel a little less annoyed of the situation.\nand I also kind of felt trapped inside Disney's world. Made it a challenge to get OUT of the Disney area without a car. We learned to catch Lynx buses at the ticket&transportation center.\n\nOverall, I super recommend Pop Century. Especially if you're on a budget or have kids. All the perks of a Disney resort at half the price. I'd definitely stay there the next time I visit Orlando.",

The bread and hummus\/dip that comes out to start off is very good and tasty... but don't overdo it because the food gets better as you go on.\n\nFor apps we had the bruschetta which came with chunks of chicken and was good (but I'm not huge on bruschetta so can't comment farther).  The calamari was fanstastic - well cooked, in a slightly spicy red sauce and the portion size was large and came with two big crostinis too.  I love that it was NOT fried like it is everywhere else you go.  We also go the eggplant\/spinach\/ricotta app and I'm pretty sure we licked that bowl clean - even the people who did not like veggies were in love with it.  I would consider it as an entree with a side of pasta in the future.\n\nI had the whole wheat linguine with squash, peas, tomatoes, mozzarella and some other veggies.  Good, light sauce and healthy but flavorful feel overall.\n\nOne friend had the gemelli with shrimp and scallops which actually sounded like the best thing on the menu but was slightly disappointing to me. The sauce was a brandy-gorgonzola, which was GOOD and quite unique but a little watery for the dish.  I would have liked them to thicken it up a bit.\n\nTwo friends got the chef's special risotto for the night and everyone was SUPER impressed with it.  Good portion size, perfect al dente, incredible flavor and lots of beautiful ingredients.  Excellent choices.\n\nAnother friend got the penne with chicken, sundried tomatoes, olives, and I forget what else.  This sounded plain on the menu but was actually quite good. I think it was my favorite thing on the table!\n\nOverall our dining experience was great and we all really liked the food.

At one point several months ago we gave up on the IMT property due to what we felt was a lack of effort. We recently revisited the IMT to give it another shot because we did love the property and we happen to get helped by Gary Stiil. From the moment he greeted us it was like night and day from any other leasing agent we had dealt with over the last three months. It was very close to closing time and in fact I suspect during the tour of the property it was past time for him to go home. He never once referred to the time and we never got the impression he was trying to hurry it along. I even mentioned it being near closing time and he shrugged it off\n\nWhen we were done we explained to him we were determined to get a first floor two bedroom apartment with a yard and would be willing to wait for that to come available. I have had this similar conversation with other leasing agents and never heard back from them even after being assured  they will contact us when one came up. Gary took our information and made the same promise. Much to my surprise two weeks later I get an email from Gary informing us that he had found the two bedroom apartment with a yard. \n\nGary is a real standout and complete professional. He made the tour enjoyable and fun and followed up on his promise. I will also add that after the tour that day my wife and I were hanging out near the property talking when we saw Gary leaving. As he walked by we talk for a moment before he went on,  and that's when I realized he was waiting for us to finish so he could go home, and never let on. So if you are looking for an apartment at this property I highly recommend working with Gary",

I sweat my ass off and after class my muscles feel like they got a good workout but also are relaxed from the stretching in the heat.  \n\nMy first class here I didn't realize it was a heated studio and didn't have a towel to put over my mat.  Don't make this mistake, otherwise you will be slipping all over your mat because it will be soaked in sweat in the first 15 minutes.  Bring a towel both for your mat and second small one to wipe your sweat!\n\nI like to hit up Adam's class on Sunday late afternoon or Lara's slow flow class on Monday nights.  Adam's classes are a great workout, which is awesome.  I know if I go to his classes often I will get pretty strong and toned, but he also keeps you centered mentally.  It's great.  Lara's classes are great as well - I feel like I am going to therapy when I leave her classes because I feel good physically but also mentally\/spiritually.  All of the instructors talk during class, but I especially like her vibe!  I've only taken one of Rebecca's classes, but it was a lot of fun - she's almost playful with the poses and she keeps it pretty light.  She does a good job describing the poses too.  So far, every instructor I have gone to have been great and I like that they each have their own distinct style and personality, so I tend to pick which class to go to depending on what I'm looking to get out of the class.  \n\nSometimes the parking lot is a bit of a zoo, especially during the time when everyone is leaving the previous class and everyone going to the next class is waiting for their spots.  \n\nAnyway, I am loving this place so if you're curious at all, just take a class or two and ENJOY!",

        "text": "* Organic food delivery in Vancouver has at least 4 competitors, and this is perhaps now my favourite. *\n\nOk, since Ladybug has sadly been having problems with the quality and accuracy lately (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/ladybug-organics-home-delivery-service-and-store-surrey#hrid:x1siIpX-AQ-T_30XwQEaMw) decided to try out Green Earth to see how they compare.  I feel like I'm cheating though!  \n\nAfter 2 weeks of the service (my organic delivery secret affair!) here are my impressions:\n\n- The ordering system is much more efficient and easy to complete.  Basically a much better website with streamlined choices.\n\n- I love how they have a recommended bin each week with the freshest produce for the week, and how much this changes from week to week to keep you constantly getting different items and keeping things interesting.\n\n- They are VERY good at only listing the produce and fruit that is actually available when you are ordering so no missing items and\/or substitutions.\n\n- They simplify their choices, so they don't offer 4 or 5 different kinds of apples for instance.  But each week they have 1 or 2 (and actually have them!).  \n\n- The quality of the produce has been on par or superior with that from Ladybug.  Been enjoying some of the sweetest carrots, creamiest sweet potatoes, non-bitter artichokes, delicious locally baked granola, crispy flavourful fuji apples, most flavour packed broccoli that I have had for a long time along with everything else.\n\n- I love that for things you order regularly you can establish a standing order and get a 5% discount (milk, eggs, etc.).\n\n- Their customer service is really on top of things.  They are very proactive and contact you quickly and efficiently.\n\nI hope this continues, and as long as it does I think it will be Green Earth going forward!  (Sorry my dear Ladybug!)",

Although I don't have many followers on here,  I'm hoping the couple of them that do see this will visit and tell their followers about it and so on and so on.\n \nThis small place on Burford Highway can be very easily missed; i mean I missed it trying to get there and had to drive back again to spot it lol, anyway came here with my friend Ravi on Monday night for dinner, we can be very indecisive about our food but the server was super patient with us and luckily spoke Spanish and English like me also, made it much easier for me to explain the food to Ravi. \n\nWe chose a few things on the menu to try out: empanadas de carne which were amazing,  also tamales or chuchitos as they call them which I have never liked from any country or my own family for that matter and my mind wasn't changed this time either, but that doesn't mean they are not good because Ravi liked them; its just my  personal taste bud. We also got pechuga a la plancha con arroz y frijoles negros which was off the chain,  and lastly a quesadilla with chorizo which was also delicious. \n\nAll in all we were very satisfied with our dinner that night and would love to come back to try their breakfast in the morning and any other plates they have. So I highly recommend it, please give it a shot, and tell more people about them cause small places like these deserve more attention than the bigger ones everyone already knows.",

        "text": "The Enormous Room is one of those places everyone should try because it's different than any other bar in Boston. What the Enormous Room does offer is something rare, but something people who are familiar with Chicago's nightlife can appreciate. \n\nIt's a lounge with a good DJ. It provides a semi-upscale, hip atmosphere for drinking, hanging out with friends and even dancing, but be sure to arrive early because the interior space resembles what would happen if a Miami nightclub and a hooka bar had a bastard child and to say seating is limited, is a gross understatement. \n\nThe deep, soft couches, pillows and overstuffed chairs lining the exposed brick walls make seating very limited. The only bar is really a window in the back of the club where waitstaff shuffle back and forth taking drink orders and generally creating poor traffic flow. \n\nMy recommendation would be to arrive early with a group of friends and claim a good space or for the more adventurous couple\/date, grab a good spot and order some of the tasty appetizers and watch all the fresh Nike kids work on their break dancing routines.  I like this place but if you don't feel like standing around and waiting for drinks, then this probably isn't for you without prior planning.",

It had an odd taste to it -- not horrible but not great. I didn't finish it and I am not someone that leaves before I finish my drink.\n\nSeafood Fondue -- VERY CHEESY and the description didn't mention that it had tons of mushrooms in it. I am not a fan of mushrooms. The cheese on the top was good but the cheese that was mixed with the seafood (scallops, shrimp & crawfish) was very runny. Not like any other seafood fondue we have ever had before.\n\nKid's Cheeseburger -- the meat was very very dry. G said he preferred the school cafeteria's burger over what was on his plate. Frozen french fries were nothing special either.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Salmon & Stuffed Shrimp -- grilled shrimp was bland and took 3 lemon wedges to give it a touch of flavor; salmon was okay but nothing special; stuffed shrimp was good but had a touch too much Old Bay Seaoning on it.\n\nCombo Plate w\/Grilled Shrimp, Blackened Catfish & Stuffed Shrimp -- E says that his grilled shimp was like mine, he liked the stuffed shrimp and the catfish was okay.\n\nRed Beans & Rice (side dish) -- this did have good flavor and I enjoyed it\nSteamed Brocoli -- nothing exciting\n\nJalapeno Hushpuppies -- I am pretty sure that someone forgot the jalapenos. These hushpuppies were bland. When I order something that has jalapeno in it, I expect a kick to it and these did not deliver at all.\n\nWe don't plan on going back again. Not sure if they were having a bad night in the kitchen or what but we weren't impressed and the customer service was okay but not enough to make us want to try it again.",

I've always wanted to try authentic okonomiyaki and takoyaki and although I'm not sure how close it is to the real thing, my experience here was unique and I found it worth the visit. \n\nThe okonomiyaki was described as a cheesy savory seafood pancake and it was exactly that. It had a nice crisp on the outside and an incredibly soft and fluffy inside. The cheesy pockets were the best! It was more salty than I imagined and the sauce on top lacked the sweetness that I originally thought it would have. The pickled ginger was also unsweetened. It wasn't an unpleasant surprise though. The seafood gave it a nice variation of texture as well. I would highly recommend it! \n\nThe omu curry rice with the pork katsu was also very delicious. The katsu was the crispiest I've ever had and the curry was very homely. The omurice had a comforting light texture to it as well and everything tasted amazing when it was all put together! \n\nI also had the takoyaki and I'm happy to report that it tasted identical to the ones you can find all over Vancouver from the night market to random sushi places. \n\nAll in all, it was a neat little place to visit at least once. The staff are extremely friendly and they have the most adorable voices! The food was very comforting but there's nothing about it flavour wise that would blew me out of the water. However, it's one of the few places that serve okonomiyaki in Vancouver so it would still be worth a visit.",

The hairdresser was a no-nonsense looking older man, who did not even slightly appear to be gay, so my first thought, sexist as it may be, was \"Oh no, he's going to destroy my hair.\" But I decided to stay, anyway. I sat down in the shampoo chair, and the hairdresser dude proceeded to massage my scalp as he washed my hair. Like REALLY REALLY massage my scalp. I didn't know hair salons even did stuff like that. It wasn't bad, but I would have appreciated a heads-up. He should have said, \"Hey, I'm about to give you a vigorous scalp massage. Hold on to your britches.\" Instead, it was a surprise, so it was awkward.\nI showed him a picture of what I wanted. He cut my hair a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but that's not a huge deal as long as the layers line up correctly. I made the mistake of saying I like it curly-- cause I do, but most hairdressers think that means they can take a round brush and make you look like a juvenile beauty pageant contestant. I ended up stopping him halfway and saying, \"Hey, just run a blow dryer through it, I prefer my natural curls.\" So he did, and it looked fine. I'm lukewarm about the haircut for now, but it might look better in the morning once I wash it.",

They would have gotten 4 from me had they stretched my meal with maybe another scoop of 2 or rice per dish.\n\nI had the etouffee and gumbo.  Each came with a small scoop of rice.  The liquid to-go containers were extremely nice.  They were large, tightly sealed plastic boxes that did not leak any of that Louisianian goodness.  That is probably the last time I will ever write a review about to-go packaging... but I was very impressed.\n\nThe crawfish etouffee was a little lighter than most.  It was a more tomato-y type sauce.  It was red, slightly tangy, and there was plenty of tender crawfish swimming around.  It was not as flavorful as some of the others I have had before, but it would have been a great pasta sauce or something.\n\nThe gumbo was a little runnier than I prefer.  It was plenty dark, but it lacked that rich flavor.  I classify it as a soup in my book, but it is definitely a flavorful soup.  There was a little too much sausage, as I prefer my gumbo ratio to lean heavier on the seafood side.  The chicken meat was extremely tender and tasty, though.  There was some tender shrimp mixed in also.\n\nCrazy Cajun offers solid Cajun food, but I would like a little bit more food and some zippier flavor.  Do check it out if you are in the Asian part of town and are hankerin' for some non-Asian food... although the guy that runs CC is Asian!  Who would have thought?",

        "text": "So, myself and five friends decided to try the famous Wahlburgers. We were curious to see what all the rave was about. We were greeted at the door by a cordial young lady and she told us the name of our waitress and that she would be right over. She approached our table within a minute or so and introduced herself. She was very kind and a great waitress. I just wish I remember her name. We went in about 6:30 PM and at that time there were only a few other parties inside eating. \n\nWe ordered our burgers and I must admit that they were all cooked to perfection. They were on the bland side and nothing to brag about. I don't think they were flame broiled on a nice hot live flame...... too bad for us. We ordered tots and they were so-so. The onion rings were very good and sliced nice and thin and yes, they were crunchy. Five had sodas and one had tea. \n\nAs we tried to carry on a conversation, it was difficult to do so. The music was extra loud and we could not hear one another talking. Three times we asked for them to please turn it down. We had planned on having a dessert and coffee afterward but we just wanted to hurry up and get out of there because the atmosphere was not pleasant. This restaurant is definitely not geared for the over forty crowd. The music was not the type any of us would listen to. It made for a tense meal. Three finished their burgers and three did not. As for the tots and fries, most of those were left behind too. We quickly asked the waitress for the bill so we could leave. Trust me, none of our meals looked like the pictures do up above. \n\nWe went around the corner to another establishment and had dessert and coffee there. The ambiance was nice and the dinner music was soothing. Ahhhhh, so relaxing..... finally. We carried on great conversation with a lot of laughs. The place was half filled at this time. \n\nHonestly, the Wahlburgers are way over their heads. They have opened up too many restaurants all over the country and out of the country. Paul and the family are not on site to see how things are being run by outsiders. Right from the beginning from watching the show, Paul was spot on when he made it known that he not happy with the expansion of Wahlburgers. He was afraid the quality would slide and go down.... it did. \n\nWithin a decade or less, I am sure you will see some of their franchises closing. When the owner is not around to watch the day to day operation, you lack the hands on approach as family is missing and that isn't good. More isn't always better and that rule applies to Wahlburgers. \n\nIf I need a burger, I am better off going to Five Guys in the next town... Peabody, Massachusetts. Better food and half the price. \n\nSorry guys, I didn't want to do this. Don't build anymore of these places as nobody from your family knows what is going on.",

Right off Congress in the shade, small picnic tables and a few chairs. It's right next to the Austin Juice trailer. (Which is also in my passbook, I plan to try that soon!)\n\nWe ordered the Croque-Madame. And then ordered a custom sandwich with a Hawaiian bun, cheddar, ham, an egg, spinach, and jalape√±o cream cilantro sauce. \n\nIt was tough for me to decide which one I liked better but I think I settled on the Croque-Madame. It was a little sweet but the flavors combines were amazing. \n\nOur custom sandwich wound up being really good too, mostly thanks to the sauce. I highly recommend the jalape√±o cream cilantro sauce.  It wasn't spicy to me at all but it had an amazing flavor. I'm a sucker for anything cilantro. \n\n*The sourdough bread did get a little soggy, but it didn't bother me (might bother others). The Hawaiian bun stayed pretty toasted and crispy.*\n\nOur sides were a fruit cup and tomato soup (cute!). The fruit cup was green apples and oranges, refreshing and the fruit tasted fresh. The tomato soup was good. Had some chunks in it, probably tomatoes. So that was a strange consistency, but the taste was really good. I think having tomato soup at a grilled cheese trailer is a great idea. \n\nI'd definitely go back to try a different combination or a different sandwich. The ones we got were really good, but I'm looking for that one to be blown away by. =]",

Heck - if you're a fan homemade tasting food, this place is for you!\n\nThis Sweet Tomatoes is located at the end of a lack-luster shopping center, so it can be difficult to find if you've never been here.  But once you walk inside, you are greeted by the salad buffet and a carpet with tomatoes printed on it (these people take their veggies seriously!).\n\nYou choose your salads and toppings prior to paying.  Patrons sit themselves in either tables or booths and the soups, bakery options, pasta, fresh fruit and ice cream are located in the back and you can go up as many times as you want to sample the many fresh and yummy offerings.\n\nMy favorite part of the buffet are the soups and pastas - so many choices - creamy and cheesey gooey macaroni and cheese and two other options that change every so often!  Also, there are certain soups and salads highlighted (and changed) each month.  For instance, in March, the theme is Latin flavors.  The bread options are abundant as well.  For example, when I last went to Sweet Tomatoes, there were four types of Focaccia bread (and they all had some type of cheese on them, so of course, I had to try them all!), muffins and biscuits.

        "text": "So my third time coming here in the past 2 weeks:\n\nI'm a fitness buff and as such I do not eat out a lot. The two allowances for this rule are coffee and sushi. Fish Market has now snagged my \"Go to Sushi Spot\" award.\n\nI'd learned a valuable lesson years ago when I had gone to a restaurant for the first time and gotten rather mediocre food. I didn't go back for over a year even though it was right next to my apartment. I went back and BOOOOM best dinner of the year that night.\n\nThis is a reason I withhold my reviews until I've been to an establishment a minimum of 2 times. Being my 3rd time at Fish Market, I must say this place is a go to spot.\n\n1) It's tiny. To some this may mean a wait that they wish not to endure. For me this means no damn screaming college kids \"HEEY MORE SAHKIIII\". It also makes it feel more like a sushi bar and less of a japanese food trough service.\n\n2) I've gotten the same waittress every time. Although the first time dining at FM there was a confusion with my order, she remedied it swiftly and with a great attitude. She's always super sweet and attentive, even promoting their \"Free ice cream\" promo while my lady and I were discussing whether or not she wanted some ice cream.\n\n3) My sushi\/ meals here have so far been consitently great. I always get a \"clean\" fresh taste from my food here. It is what I now expect. If the sushi were priced higher, as it is at some restaurants, I would not hate it due to the great quality. I have yet to try the acclaimed Avocado ball, but everything from my Eel Handroll to the Chirashi and Sushi Deluxe have been amazing.\n\n4) Price is great. It's also why I do not fear leaving great tips. $5 tip on a $15 should ont be considered exemplary but it seems it is by current standards. Either way, don't hate when I get my food before you.",

Val has been on her game in the Couve for about 2.5 years now, after refining her most sacred shao-lin technique with her hot pots, in downtown Portland \"for about 15-16 years.\"\n\nDeserving special mention from the menu were the triple-decker Ruebenator, and the philly cheese-steak scramble. So much tender, juicy meat! I'd drive out of my way out to the Couve, to order either of these entrees again.\n\n\nThe one glaring omission in Val's business model is the lack of accessibility. She's only open a few hours a day. True, she's built a booming business with legions of adoring fans and in all likelihood simply doesn't need to hire more staff to stay open later. The problem being, there's a vast cross-section of potential and acutal fans of Val's that work swing or graves that are largely, effectively cut off from having access, and this little diner is a place that deserves plenty of exposure to the masses. Should Val ever consider  later hours (esp on weekned nights), that'll be just the bump needed for instant 5 star accolades.  If Stepping Stone can do it, you most definitely can dooo it.\n\nVal and co: you're a shining star, no matter who you are. Shining bright to see, what you could truly be...",

        "text": "So, I went to this Cabela's on Black Friday to purchase the Walther PPS.  They were out already (of course), but gave me a \"Firearms Request Form\" and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock.  A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks.\n\nTwo weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabela's.  So I start a series of polite calls to the store.  And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with \"Jay\", who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00.  After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s).  \n\nNeedless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call.  Apparently once I left the store with that \"Firearms Request Form\", my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela's trash can.  Or so I surmise, because Cabela's REALLY didn't seem to want my $370.  Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess.  So I took my business to one of Cabela's local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didn't have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela's.\n\nI do hope someone at Cabela's sees this review, and finds out why a customer can't receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all.  Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back.  Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabela's, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service.  Going forward I think I'll take a pass on Cabela's.  And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabela's you may or may not get it.  Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache.",

        "text": "We met some friends for drinks in the tap room on a busy Saturday night (at around 10:00PM). The restaurant was hopping, with a short wait for a table. But the tap room downstairs had plenty of seating, and quick dual-bartender service. Some nice things to note about the tap room: 1) you can enter from the back of the restaurant where most people park, 2) if you are a smoker you can pop in and out, 3) there is plenty of bench seating for large groups, 4) this floor has it's own restrooms (clean ones), 5) you can request a table for dinner, and then hang out in the tap room until the table is available. It got a little noisy in there, but only after they started to fill up. The room is really large, and had nice lighting (and clean tables).\n\nThe drinks weren't too bad. It was a strange selection for as many beers as they had. I am an IPA fan myself, but with the 20 some beers on tap, there was one IPA, and one Imperial IPA. I did a beer flight of 5 beers for $12.50. I have had cheaper flights! When I couldn't decide on a fifth beer I asked the bartender to give me a wildcard and surprise me and she gave me a \"Bucharaht\" (sp?). To me, it tasted a bit like bacon. I passed it around the table, and everyone agreed it had a nice smoked flavor. I ended up having to order a full beer of it.\n\nThe bartender was not the friendliest I have ever had, hence not a five star in my book. You expect a little more personality, I guess. But I got beer, relatively fast, and was able to cash out after every order (not knowing how long we would stay).\n\nI noticed parking was a pain. We were staying in town and went on foot. I would suggest parking somewhere central and hoofing it. We also made use of Uber which worked in our favor for the night.",

When I went in for a consultation twice (I wasn't prepared to drop off my phone the first time), both the repair person as well as the people at the front desk 1. explained the process to me step by step 2. was clear about the cost 3. accurately gave me an estimation of how long it would take them to fix it and 4. told me they would contact me if anything we discussed changed. \n\nAfter picking up my phone on time, they told me that because they just needed to clean the phone (there was \"goo\" inside that was causing the button issue) there would be no charge because they didn't really have to \"fix\" anything and was deemed a consultation. WHO DOESN'T CHARGE PEOPLE FOR EVEN A CONSULTATION! I WAS BEYOND SHOCKED AND ECSTATIC since I was ready to buy a new phone! Whatever they were going to charge me for the repair was reasonable which is why I decided to go with them initially, but then the customer service aspect was just the icing on the cake.\n\nIn addition, there was a constant stream of people coming in for all reasons, so apparently it's in the know and I was just late to the party. As long as they can fix my electronic items, I probably won't go anywhere else and frankly you shouldn't either. And who doesn't like to shop local! THANKS A TON!",

        "text": "I was wandering down N. Mississippi recently, killing time before a happy hour meet up with some friends, and happened across CD-Game Exchange, so I decided to stop in and browse for a few. The place impressed me quite a bit, and I'll always try to go back and search the racks for a cheap find anytime I'm back in the neighborhood.\n\nI've seen other CD-Game Exchange locations around Portland, and a long time ago I stopped into the Hawthorne location but failed to find the specific discs I was looking for. I think this location on Mississippi is similar in that you probably shouldn't go looking for one specific disc, artist, or game - this is no Everyday Music or Music Millennium.\n\nBut if you're just browsing, it's definitely worth checking them out because they do have a pretty decent selection of used CDs, at really reasonable prices. They have a decent selection of discs priced in the $1-5 range, and more priced a few bucks higher. And the bargain priced discs aren't all from bands of which you've never heard or never want to hear.I managed to score a copy of \"Honey, I'm Homely\" by the Dance Hall Crashers for only $1[!] and it plays just fine.\n\nI'm not really a gamer these days, so I didn't look at their selection or pricing of video games, but if it's anything like their CD inventory it's worth checking out.\n\nThey have a fair return\/buy-back policy which diminishes a little each day you have the CD or game, so if you have a little buyer's remorse you're not completely out of luck.\n\nAs I say, it's not the best place to go searching for that one special CD, but they have enough stuff for you to browse and likely find something you want at very reasonable prices.",

        "text": "I've been for brunch a few times, but I'm sort of meh about brunch. Just don't really eat pancakes and all that stuff, and they do a nice job with two eggs, but it's not exactly something I would get crazy enough to write a review about.\nThen I needed a last minute place for dinner. They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....\n\nThey had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. \n\nThen, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. \n\nWhen I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. \n\nUnlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food. I like that I can get in without making a reservation a week in advance, like some other spots on Tremont. I'll definitely be back at this excellent neighborhood cafe.",

        "text": "(Updated 5\/25\/2013)\n\n\nThe audacity of that poster who thinks those of us who have been insulted by the rude staff are placing \"worthless\" reviews.  Who the hell is he to determine how we feel about the rude and ignorant way we have been served and treated?  His \"great\" service does not make ours any less authentic or real.   The nerve of him  to even suggest otherwise. Even have the audacity to think that someone is insecure and have personal issues because the wait staff was extremely disrespectful. No, it's not their fault it's everyone else's. Yeah right!   Not everyone is going to have the same experience and the staff should treat all its patrons with respect, courtesy, and kindness. I have been in a LOT of places of all walks of life and I very rarely experience this kind of ignorance!  Your experience is yours and our experience is ours and we rate honestly and accordingly!!  Point, Blank, and Period.  If Costello's do not want bad reviews then they NEED TO HAVE A TALK with their staff.  That is what good business people do!! I guess we should suck up the disrespectful treatment because the waitstaff is having a bad day?  Are you fkn kidding me?  When you are in the \"hospitality\" business you be hospitable regardless of what you have to deal with and what kind of day you are having.  Unbelievable!!   \n\nIf you want to be treated well by staff and have GREAT food and quality service  and drinks then I strongly suggest you walk ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GALWAY HOUSE!   They also make an excellent dirty martini!  Bartenders and staff are super friendly.  \n\nNow on to the original review:\n\nI haven't been to this place in years.  So I decide to check it out last night because they had a live band. I am giving this place one star due to the horrible attitude of the female bartender.  I am talking MAJOR attitude.  If you don't like your job  dealing with the public then find another line of work.  Her disrespectful tone and pinched up face was extremely disturbing to Me.  I won't ever go into that place again because of her for if she talked to Me and treated Me like that again she would see My ugly side.  The male bartender was much more friendlier!   If I ever go in there again it will not be on a day when she's working.  Very disrespectful.  You don't disrespect and give attitude to the f**&n customers and expect tips!! \n\nI ended up leaving there and going to Coco's Lounge. The hospitality shown at CoCo's lounge by the owner was exceptional.  Very friendly.  The waitresses had a smile, spoke to you with respect, and the service was fast!  The patrons were nice and the latin music was good.  Much better experience  I must say.  When I go somewhere and I am spending My money I expect to be treated with respect by the staff persons and not spoken to with attitude! \n\nPeriod!!\n\nIf anyone knows the owner\/s of Costello's PLEASE let Me know via email.  I am pretty offended by this bartender and I hope she isn't a relation.  They need better staff.  Hell I'll work there and give the patrons service with a f**^n smile!!!",

Drinks came pretty quickly, but ordering took a while for a waiter to come back.  The food came aok, but then things went downhill.  It took forever to get a check as we couldn't get any of the bartenders' attention (and my friend had to get home to her child)  We finally got a check and it was 120 - umm, not our check. So then we had to wait to try to get someone's attention. Then we got our check.  But no one coming back to take payment. I finally got up, walked to the other side of the  bar, and got a bartender's attention to take my payment. I explained all these delays and he apologized and said he would review with staff (we told hostess too), but no offer of comping bill, or credit for future or anything and now the parking cost more in the lot because it took forever to get out of there - I think it was after 10p at this point!  My friend and I were exhausted and annoyed.  If you are going to seat people at the bar, you need to have normal service, and bring the right check, and collect payment so people can get out.  And then when we tell you it's a disaster, you should try to make good in some fashion.  Sorry really isn't enough when you've ruined our evening.  Getting more and more disappointed in this chain.",

        "text": "I echo many of the previous reviews.  First, be very careful to review the \"professional design\" they put together for you.  We had 24\" sections that the salesperson filled with 21\" cabinets and a 3\" spacer which look VERY odd.  In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don't look quite right.  instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact.  And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions.  The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible.\n\nSecond, they do not call back.  If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will.  It will be a one-way street of communication.  Guaranteed.  I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening.  Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work.  Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise.  Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it.  Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. \n\nYou are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box.  You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc.  Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week?  6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice.\n\nAnd I agree with other reviews.  The cabinets are nice, but the price is not lower than other options.  Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around, not a cheaper option.  We are happy with our kitchen, but it was painful.",

After waiting for about 40 minutes we asked the host what was going on?  He explained to us people were not leaving etc.....he finally got us a couch to sit at while we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for a table of 4. The service was so so poor.  Finally the host told us how sorry he was and he would give us complimentary dessert.  We felt better that as least they understood we had waited forever.  We sat and our server again apologized to us about how long we had to wait and reminded us about our free dessert more than once.  The food was sub-par to say the least.  The restaurant was SUPER loud because of the wedding going on next door and the bridal party kept running in and out of the restaurant getting drinks at the bar.  After we finished dinner we decided we would just order 2 desserts to spit between both couples.  When we ordered the two $6.00 desserts the waitress proceeded to tell us that we would only be getting one dessert free!  Needless to say, horrible customer service and not very bright wait staff, the least she could have done was go ask if they could comp our $12.00 worth of dessert that they had reminded is 4 time that we would be getting.

We ordered our food to-go so I cannot comment on the whole experience of Sofrito but what I can tell you is that the food is outstanding, the prices are way more than reasonable and in Orlando? Is that even possible? \n\nYou order at the counter, take a number and wait as patiently as you can for the deliciousness to be brought to you. The staff is friendly, helpful, and our food came quickly. The atmosphere seemed inviting and warm, even with board games!, so I wish that we had been able to stay. This is a perfect restaurant to stay awhile and chat or to get in and out if you are in a time crunch. \n\nAnd as for the food, I don't think you can wrong with whatever you choose. I had the Media Noche sandwich, a Cuban with ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Melt in your mouth scrumptious and overall fantastic flavor. I couldn't get enough. The mustard is pretty strong so be mindful if this isn't your thing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the other dishes, but our party also ordered empanadas which received only positive feedback and the Polla A La Brasa (White), chicken with herbs. The entrees are served with three (small) sides and a (small) salad. We went with yellow rice, yucca fries and toasted plantains which were all excellent choices and I'm glad that we divvied them up so the three of us could all try. Loved the sauces that were served alongside, they were versatile enough to go with just about anything...so tasty! Wish I could have tried the empanadas and chicken, they both looked and smelled fantastic.\n\nI'm bummed that I didn't get a chance to try the flan or Cuban-style espresso...so don't short yourself out...make sure to indulge in one of the delicious-looking desserts. If you go to Orlando and don't stop at Sofrito, all I can say is that you will miss out.",

It's much more convenient for me than trekking to Chinatown or Dorchester for pho, and there are so many tables, I've never had to wait in line.\n\nTheir portions are quite generous and for under $10, you get a pretty tasty meal. For the pho, I always ask to get my eyeround beef raw on a separate plate rather than in the soup so that I can cook it myself, and it's awesome. I've done this over 20 times and have never gotten sick, so I do trust their meat. \n\nTheir bun (vermicelli) dish is my favorite and I love the ones with meat and crispy rolls. There's lots of veggies on it and I devour the whole dish soaked with fish sauce. \n\nTheir pork chops and catfish are both very good as well. The only bummer is that over the years, it seems they've started to skimp on the shrimp and pork spring rolls which I used to love. Since the portions are so big, I've stopped getting appetizers, although the shrimp toast and the quail were both tasty when I used to get them.\n\nThe shakes take a while and aren't better than nearby competitors, so I usually stick with the coconut juice which they put baby coconut in.\n\nI generally go every few months and during the winter, maybe every few weeks. (On a side note, after visiting Vietnam and having pho there, I actually enjoy the pho here better for the flavor and generous toppings.) Don't expect it to be mindblowing. I just really enjoy how consistent, simple, and good it always is.",

Every dentist that I have gone too has treated me in a sub-human way because, unfortunately I was not blessed with the greatest of teeth, and was treated as if I didn't care about them so they didn't care what they did to them. \nThis is THE place to go to be treated with kindness, compassion, non- judgment and complete professionalism. \nDr. Daby did not do what every other Dentist has done to me like just saying \"your teeth and gums are beyond repair so when you are ready I'll pull them all out for you when you get dentures.\" Instead, he did a through exam and found teeth that could stay and recommended a partial. \nAll the preparation before getting the actual partial was completely painless and all of his staff were so kind and considerate. Not \"condescendingly kind,\" but \"truly\" kind. \nWhen the day came for the actual \"pulling\" of my teeth (I only lost six!) I was very nervous and anxious. My sister came with me to hold my hand and support me through it and it went very well, after it was all finished and I saw myself in the mirror it made me cry. All of my worst fears were for not and I am SO happy with the results. \nThank you Dr. Daby and all the staff at Smiles on Sandy I am grinning from ear to ear again!",

        "text": "An open letter to TCV:\nRecently I missed an appointment. I understood the policy of charging a fee for a missed appointment and completely accept that as fair and reasonable. However I received a letter in the mail today regarding my missed appointment that was completely offensive and unprofessional. The letter stated that if I missed 3 appointments in a 12 month rolling period \"for reasons that we do not find acceptable\" I will no longer be permitted to receive care from any TCV location. I'm going to tell a couple things: It is not MY privilege to be your customer, it is your privilege to have ME as a customer. Your customers can choose to be with a company that values their business, you however can not exist without customers. Secondly, who are you to determine what is an acceptable reason for missing an appointment? Have you elected a \"Missed appointenet czar\" who will determine my fate based on their arbitrary judgement? Why I missed an appointment in frankly none of your business. I and I alone will determine whether I have something more important or not. Your arrogance in this statement only highlights your obtuse regard for customer service. \nAt this point, I will most likely search for a new privider whom I believe values me as customer. Considering that you view my business as a annoying obligation, you probably won't care much about my departure. But maybe you will realize that you have lost site of the basics of growing a business which is that every customer should feel appreciated and serviced with respect, and you will redirect your policies to reflect those values.",

        "text": "This is the third hospital my father was transferred to after he fell very ill almost two weeks ago.  The best one by far.  My mom, my brother, or I have been staying in the room 24 hours a day, got to see many nurses, doctors, assistants, housekeeping staff, meal delivery people.  Every single person is polite, friendly, caring.  Not only do they act unhurried, willing to take their time and answer questions, gentle and patient with my dad, while constantly apologizing to him for disturbing him even as he sleeps through most of the visits, we, the family members, are asked if there is anything that we need by almost every person who walks into the room.  Our requests are met with nods and smiles.  Our 7th floor room is clean, large, with a huge window that offers us a view of Downtown and the Capitol, plus great sunsets.  In my sleep-deprived state I find myself routinely referring to it as a hotel rather than hospital room.  Food is surprisingly decent, some offerings I've tried were restaurant quality, for sure.  Even the security guards were pleasant and polite when I left the building after hours and realized I had to go through metal detectors and bag search on my way back into the building.  Considering very trying circumstances that brought us to this hospital, we feel like everyone had tried to make sure we were as comfortable as possible the week we had spent there so far.",

        "text": "This was our first stop on our Austin trip, and I thought it was a cool place. We decided to stop in for brunch on a Saturday because it looked like our kind of spot and because it didn't seem too busy. Overall, the food was good, the drinks we very good, and the service was just OK. \n\nI'm a big fan of a good bloody mary, so I decided to go with the $4 bloody mary special they were having. Great drink. It tasted very fresh and like they spiced it themselves (rather than using some kind of purchased mix). You could see the fresh black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (which added a nice heat) floating in the drink. This was probably my favorite part of the experience. \n\nMy wife got the local beer flight, but they were out of a couple of beers, so they substituted others that were not local. No prob here: all of the beers were good. They have a decent selection of beers to choose from, too. \n\nFor my meal, I got the cobb salad, which was good. It was a nicely dressed salad topped with grilled chicken, fresh avocado, hardboiled egg, bacon, and feta cheese. I enjoyed it. My wife got the tacos, which she liked. \n\nAll in all, I would have gone with 4*, but the service was a little rough. Our waitress unexpectedly changed in the middle of our service (no one told us; a new person just started coming over to ask if we needed anything), and it was difficult to get the check at the end of the meal. I asked our new server, who forgot, and then I asked the hostess, who had to go ask our server again. Not a disaster, but not really smooth either. \n\nI would definitely give the Ale House another try if I came back to Austin.",

        "text": "I've been to this location a couple of times, the service has never been great but I've come back for the good food. This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.",

        "text": "I can't tell you how disappointed we were in a late brunch here.  After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch.  There were six of us celebrating a birthday.  \n\nIt started with a less than friendly greeting at the front door.  Our waitress was unfriendly, lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in.  That's right, we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order.  She didn't offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer.\n\nWhen our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything.  We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order.  She looked up and said, \"oh, yeah, you wanted sticky buns.  I'm looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out.\"   I said, \"well, that's unfortunate, because you had them when we came in.  Do you think you can check?\"  She said, \"I'll see if we might have one In the back.  Are you ready to order?\"  We all looked at each other and thought, oh my god...are we being punked?\n\nWe ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split.  Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience.  We ordered our food and it came out quickly.\n\nWe ordered the prawns and polenta.  The prawns were okay but we're not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor. The polenta could have used some salt, cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop.  The corn beef hash was over spiced (it tasted like a bottle of Mrs. Dash fell into the pan).  The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced.  The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp.  The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato souffl√© (it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut). It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top, less than a teaspoon.  The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned. \n\nWhen the waitress finally came over to check in on us, our drinks empty, she rattled off quickly, \"everything good, everybody love everything? I looked at her like are you kidding me, \"No.  Can you tell me what's on top of this waffle?  Is it some kind of whipped cream?\" Her response was, \"It's a sweet potato souffl√©, I can get you whipped cream.\"  I looked at her and said no thank you.  She walked away, didn't ask if she could get me anything else and didn't ask if we would like anything else to drink.\n\nThe food can be improved upon, bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not.  Taste your food before going out and dedicate some time to training your people to give an experience.  I for one would rather drive downtown for better food, great service and an experience I'm willing to tell my friends about. \n\nThis unfortunately, will not be a place I would recommend.",

I originally went in with a bike I'd had for 5 years (from Craigslist!) and never really maintained.  I knew it was in rough shape and had an idea what might be wrong, but Justin looked it over thoroughly then and there was really honest about how much work\/money was needed to make it safe and rideable again - key for me as I'm 4 1\/2 months pregnant and bike commute to my downtown job.  When I got another bike, I brought it there right away for a tuneup and again, they did a fantastic job.  A few weeks later, I started having trouble with it - gears wouldn't change, chain seemed to be skipping, tension on the chain was getting much higher - and when it finally seized on me right in the middle of the Main\/Union intersection at 7.30am, I wheeled it back to the store and knocked the door.  Bob was there early and with no hesitation, let me in and had it up on the stand right away.  He called me before 10am with the prognosis and I was able to pick up my bike and cycle home that night.  Not only did he replace the faulty part with a part that will likely last the lifetime of the bike, but he also looked the bike over for free, even checking a wheel that he replaced for me the previous time.    They are just AWESOME.  Love love love you guys - if you have a bike, this is where you need to go.  Great prices, service is outstanding and they really know their stuff.  This is a no BS bike shop fo sho.",

        "text": "We went for a birthday celebration and because the birthday boys girlfriend was interested in potentially working in the kitchen when she graduates from culinary school. It was all of our first time. The restaurant was a huge vast empty room at 7 o clock on a Sunday. There were 2 tables sitting outside on this beautiful Sunday evening. We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations, decided to sit at a table. Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps. The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types. We asked if we could get items off the 'cafe' menu and he didn't know and then informed us the kitchen said no. He didn't write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks, forgot an appetizer (and when we asked about it, was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it????) and got one of the main courses wrong. And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders. Twice I had to get up to ask for more water. And this is an empty restaurant! I personally have been a server for the last 15 years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy. For the kind of money you're charging, the food better be damn good and even better service. The food was alright but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. No wonder the place was empty.",

        "text": "They were just OK but I would not use them again or recommend them personally. We used them twice for one move. First to put some of our stuff in storage while staging our home and then for the final move a couple months later. The move went relatively smoothly but there were definitely some issues. First, they sent someone out ahead of the move so they could give us an estimate and make sure they had enough truck space. Even with that, they underestimated and there was stuff we had to put in our own vehicles and friends vehicles to transport ourselves AND we had to come all the way back to pick up even more stuff that didn't fit on the trucks. Second, we called ahead of time to discuss moving our Yamaha upright piano. They assured me they could do it, they do it ALL the time. There would be an additional charge of $200. $100 for each set of stairs. It took 4 of them over 30 mins to get it down the first set of stairs, it was so hard to watch I left the room. Then when we got to the new home, they got trapped on the first set of stairs, losing control of it and it ended up falling into the wall and putting a big dent and hole in it. We were calm and cool about it, even though this was a brand new home, and asked if THEY were all okay. Telling them, their safety and well being was our first concern, it's just a wall, etc. They were all white as ghosts and did not look confident at all about getting it up the stairs the rest of the way. We then we told them to just bring it down and move on to emptying the rest of the truck, they look relieved. We haven't even had the piano checked yet, so who knows what that adventure did to the piano. Third, when trying to navigate the treadmill to the second floor, they again got trapped at the first landing. The treadmill had to be lifted over a railing and turned but they had their shortest guy at the front and he just couldn't lift it high enough. On the last attempt, they lost control again and my husband had to help. He ended up having his end of the treadmill fall on his shoulder b\/c he was trying to stop it from hitting the head of the smaller crew member. Once the move was finally over, the damage that was done to the house during the move was written on the receipt by the crew boss and this is where our experience turned from okay to crap. When we called first thing Monday morning, we were told that we had to send a certified letter explaining the damages. We asked why would we have to send something in writing explaining it when you're looking at what your crew boss wrote on the receipt. They told us they would have their drywall guy call us, he's the best and he does this kind of repair all the time. That never happened. We called back and have emailed several times but to no avail. A lot of, \"well, let me reach out to him and have him touch base with you.\" They're great at lip service. We ultimately sent that certified letter, got a return receipt and still, it's been 8 weeks since the move and we haven't heard from anyone. So, while they can move heavy items, SOME heavy items, from point A to point B, God forbid there is a problem. They do not make solving the problem as much of a priority as getting the business.",

        "text": "My experience in the store today was so bad that I decided it needed to be noted. I needed a black sweater for work and I live right down the street from this location so i made a quick trip there to get one. I walk in the store and after a few minutes I was greeted by a male employee that was very friendly. I find a sweater I liked and go back to the fitting rooms to try it on. No one was back there so after a minute or two I let myself in one of the rooms. Once I am ready to check out, I go to registers up front. No one was up there either so I wait. A redhead girl walks up after a few minutes and says nothing to me, just grabs the sweater from the counter and starts ringing it up. I mention to her that I had an email for a free nail polish with purchase. She asks to see it so I pull it up on my phone to show her. She looked at it and then says \"i'll be right back\". I wait longer for her to come back up to the front and finish ringing me up. She finally comes back up and hands me a sheet up paper with nail polish names on it and says those are the ones I could get. I pick about 10 up to see if the names on the bottom match the names on the list while she stands there and watches me. After I found none that actually were on the list I asked if they even had any of the ones that were offered in the promotion. She said, \"I think we have the space blue\". (After I had looked at all of them!!!) I give up on the nail polish and say never mind. No apology or anything from her. She just continues to ring up my sweater and after that whole ordeal and her rude attitude, I decide that there is no way in hell I am about to pay $70 for a generic black sweater I could get anywhere else. I told her I no longer wanted it and I walked out. I was willing to pay the price for convince just because I wanted it immediately, but she completely pissed me off and ruined my experience. I won't be going back any time soon.",

This isn't really a fault as much as a marketing success for Hopdoddy, but considering it increases the time that separates me and a juicy hot meat patty I have to consider it a negative. Also you can't really have groups come eat here, I'd consider 4 a comfortable max, otherwise your chances of getting split up increase by a lot and how are you going to explain \"bros before hoes\" to your wife before you ditch the bitch?\n\nOnce you finally get through customs though and place your order get ready for the best burger high of your life. I recommend the shroom burger exclusively, unless they happen to have an appetizing burger of the week. \nThe shroom burger comes specially with pesto, portabella mushrooms, and goat cheese layered on a brioche bun. The buns are soft and buttery, perfectly baked in house. In a bite, the bun holds the package together well until you get to the real meat of the sandwich. Thick rich meat juice runs across your tongue as your salivary glands ejaculate in excitement, swathed in the creaminess of goat cheese. The nuttiness of the pesto accentuates the patty well, and the herbiness of the garlic gives a gentle bite that makes your spine shiver in anticipation of the next bite. Last but not least, the mushrooms add a good texture for a layered mouthfeel, their mellow earthiness blends well with the meat for a further enriched taste that will have you gnashing away at your burger like a crack addict looking for that next hit. Before you know it, the crack is gone and you're left staring at your tray wondering if it really happened. \n\nIf you happened to have fasted that day and are a sweet-tooth, the milkshakes are worth the splurge. Despite the fact the nutella & pretzel shake is often poorly mixed, this just means you have a salty ball of chilled hazelnut chocolate waiting at the bottom of your shake, the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.\n\nThe fries are pretty good, but not a main attraction by any stretch of the imagination. Overall - if you're feeling like you make enough money to justify spending this much on a nice patty hit Hopdoddy up. If you're on a budget go to \nP. TERRY's for the same quality but much cheaper.",

What I think makes Ho Ho stand out is the nicer interior.  It'd be a place that I would want to take company and guests to for a more formal dinner.  Service is also fast and efficient.  You can also see the seafood in the tanks!\n\nThat being said, it is also farther away than either of the other 2 cantonese restaurants here in ATX.\n\nFood was pretty good, very homely chinese feel for me.  We got:\n\n1. BBQ sampler: duck, roast pork and bbq pork.  It was a bit cold which was kinda disappointing. \n2. Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup: Good, its been awhile since I last had this and the flavors reminded me of home.  I thought it was a bit salty, but everyone else thought it wasn't salty enough....\n3. Beef with Chinese Broccoli:Tastes good, nothing special though.\n4. Scallops with Chinese Vegetables: They don't skimp of the scallops thats for sure.  Vegetables are well flavored in the sauce too.\n5.  Some Crispy Shrimp dish: don't remember what its called but it was nice and crunchy, not too much taste beyond the fried though.\n6. Chinese Pork Chop- really good, again something that reminds me of home.  Hard to describe the complexity of the flavors but its a must try.\n7. Beef Flat Noodle- the only thing really disappointing on the menu (my favorite dish).  Not that special and defintiely better at First chinese bbq.  Larger portion here though...\n8. Seafood hotpot- good, but not great.  The broth was on the weaker side, but still retained that unique hotpot flavor.  Too many veggies though.\n\nCome try it if you're around!",

        "text": "About a week ago, my friend and I spotted this place on our way home from dinner and decided that next week we give it a try. \nWe opted out of dessert over at Flemings to try the crepes here instead. Sorry to say, we were both VERY disappointed in this place and won't be coming back. \nI hate leaving a review like this, but I'd rather be honest about MY experience. First of all, I'm German and I know good crepes. When I walked in, we weren't even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there. He didn't have much of a personality and frankly, I thought he was a bit rude. \nI asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was. They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from, and he didn't even know what cafe con leche was??? \nWe both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe. When I watched him make it, he literally \"drizzled\" a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana. Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all! The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didn't have much of a taste to it either. \nThere is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they don't have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! \nWe both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!!\nThey have it decorated nicely and it's very clean. The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly. I don't like giving reviews like this, but...that's what Yelp is for and maybe someone else will have a better experience than we did.",

        "text": "Here's the deal.  I've never been anywhere NEAR Greece.  I didn't even know how to pronounce gyro until I asked the owner, who is a very nice and approachable woman (like another user mentioned (I wanted to confirm), it's \"yiro.\").  All I know is that I tried the lamb gyro and it was very tasty.  It was a bit small for the price ($9 with some greens that I ended up stuffing into it because it looked bare otherwise).  However, the owner (I think it was her) was super nice and out of nowhere walked up to me and the other gentleman who was there working on his laptop and handed us some \"bagnye\" or something like that.  Basically it was deep-fried sweet balls over honey drizzle, sprinkled with cinnamon.  These were really good.  Granted, I love honey and cinnamon; I could DRINK this mixture all day.  The consistency was just right.  I guess I got on her good side by complimenting the dessert so much that a few minutes later she walked out with another serving.  At this point I hadn't even touched my gyro but soon found myself well on my way to devouring the 2nd complimentary plate of bagnyes.  \n\nThe bread on the gyro was spongy and the meat was flavorful and tender.  I've been to other places where the bread is extremely tough and elastic, and it doesn't matter how good the insides are because I end up just spilling my meal all over the place.  This was not the case here.  The food came out quickly and it was nice and hot.  Overall it was a good experience.  Will return periodically.",

        "text": "My dear Yeeps, I'm going to let you in on a closely guarded and rather intimate secret of mine. Sometimes, when no one's looking, when the shadows fall just so, and when most heads are turned.. \n\n.. sometimes I dress like an actual human female. \n\nBeyond that, I occasionally do unheard of, taboo things like accessorize and wear shoes that don't have thick rubber soles or steel shanks. However, the majority of my available funds after the monthly necessities like rent, food, booze, and hair dye are spent in the pursuit of mountain summits. Sometimes that means money for summit beers or seeking that elusive small town post-climb vegan meal. \n\nThis creates quite a conundrum for your humble reviewer. The infrequent desire to appear what some might call \"attractive\" (or \"showered\" or \"not in tattered jeans\"), but very little money with which to accomplish such lofty goals. Enter: Ether. I only noticed this place when someone pointed it out to me on a bike ride. I was instantly in love since their front-of-store display included my three guiltiest pleasures in the world: scarves, hats, and tall boots. \n\nMy initial (and only, thus far) visit revealed a whole new time and money-sink for me. Scarves, large earrings, an impressive array of boots (most of which I l love, all of which are non-leather), a small but cute selection of clothing, large wooden bangles.. pretty much everything I love to wear condensed into one modest store (minus the overly shiny rings and pendants), and priced so that even your average gear-hording mountaineer can afford to retire her current pair of boots with the half-detached left sole. \n\nTo top it off, the store is staffed by some of the most helpful, cheerful, but unobtrusive and non-pushy employees ever. \n\nAs others have said, the quality isn't top-notch, but since my episodes of masquerading as an actual female are few and far between - it's good enough for me!",

        "text": "Great Italian food!\n\nHad a reservation for dinner with the boyfriend.  When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  \n\nPros:\nThe food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).\n\nCons:\nThe draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.  \n\n\nThe interior\/ambiance of the restaurant leaves something to be desired but if you are looking for really good Italian food, visit Andiamo and you will not be disappointed!",

        "text": "BE SURE TO READ ENTIRE POST!!!  For years, the guys at April Realty\/Aero Lawn Maintenance have occasionally mowed and trimmed my yard, a huge 7 acre mini-ranch in south Austin.  Even though they mow it infrequently, I'm always amazed that they remember from year to year all the little details. They do an excellent job, show up on time,  are friendly and courteous, and charge a fair price.  I can only afford to have them do it 3 or 4 times a year and I do the rest.   \n\nWhile they were mowing my yard a few weeks ago, a member of the crew accidentally hit my Toyota truck and put a fair-sized dent in the left front fender.  I didn't see him do it, and without an eyewitness I thought,  'Oh crap, this won't turn out well'. \n\nNervously, I called the owner, fearing that I might encounter the sort of denial and resistance we all run into all too often these days.  But what I got instead was what we all would like to find in such a situation: accountability.\n\nThe owner never hesitated to take responsibility.  His name is David, and I've met him a few times over the years.  And the way he handled what happened is the way every business owner should handle such situations.\n\nThe next day, I received a call from his insurance company, two days later an adjustor came out,  and within a week, I received a check for the damage.\n\nThat's how things are supposed to work.  That's called integrity, honesty, serving the customer.  And even though it's a little thing, it's the sort of thing that helps, even slightly, to restore your faith in people. And because it's become such a rare thing today, I wanted to point it out and say \"Thank You\".    \n\nFinally, we've gotten some rain and my grass is growing again.  In fact, I just noticed it's looking a little shaggy.  And thanks to David and the guys at April Realty, I know exactly who to call.",

        "text": "I go to a lot of Japanese restaurants, and Samurai has consistently been my #1 for almost 2 years and counting! If I'm Downtown during dinnertime or lunchtime, you'll most likely find me at Samurai.\n\nThe food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!\n\nThe service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before.\n\nI would most definitely recommend Samurai. The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is in the heart of Davie St., so during peak hours there will be quite a wait to get a seat.",

        "text": "Argh. I just want to preface this by saying:\n I've been here several times for Dim Sum (say, 5-6) and once for regular dinner service. I know it's pricey for Dim Sum. \n\nDinner was great. It was a long time ago.. I don't remember what we got exactly but it was delicious and beautifully presented. A bit more than what you'd normally pay at a regular Chinese joint, but the hike in price was more than represented in quality of food.\n\nDim Sum the next several times was lovely. A little more expensive than usual, but the exceptional Shanghai dumplings made up for it. My boyfriend and I could still be stuffed for ~$35 (including a bloody mary or two)... This time the bill was over $50 and we definitely weren't nearly  so stuffed..\n\nThe last time however, something was wrong. I could hardly enjoy the food as each time we selected something from a cart and our card was marked, we were rather suspicious that we were being charged incorrectly. We got 6 dishes, and 3 of them were absolutely marked incorrectly. One was off-menu but 2 little steamed chicken buns should not be a L when comparable items (all other steam buns or chicken buns) were S or M priced dishes..\n\nThe one that really got our goat was being charged the 'Special' price ($7.95) for the pork shanghai dumplings (should have just been the XL price).. We've eaten 2 orders of these every time we've been here and have tried the ones with crab (don't like 'em as much) and these were most definitely JUST pork...\n\nSo yeah. $8 for 3 little dumplings. That's insane. A fourth item (shrimp won tons) was off-menu  as well and we were charged for an XL when comparable items were priced lower. $8 for 2 fried shrimp pockets. They were fantastically delicious, but damn. Not $8 worth of delicious.\n\nI generally don't hesitate to bring the bill to someone and question things if need be, but damn I just didn't feel like it.. I was just so disappointed that I was feeling potentially taken advantage of by this caliber of place that I have enjoyed so much in the past. I felt totally dejected and betrayed. \n\nI should NOT have to worry about paying the \"Stupid Tax\" here. You know, when you notice there's a random $2.95 charge on your bill and when you ask someone about it they don't even investigate, they just go \"Oh I'm so sorry! I'll take it off!\". .That's the stupid tax. If you've never noticed it on a bill before, you've probably paid it a few times. I'm generally on the lookout for it, but places definitely gain my trust and I let my guard down.\n\nI've eaten Dim Sum  at many other places where there was no price listing to look at, and there wasn't a single English word on the little tally sheets, and I've never felt cheated before. If they've changed priced, they need to fucking make note of that on the item\/price listings they leave on your table. I hope they're not just trying to take advantage of people's ignorance and hesitance to ask questions when they're sliding food onto your table if you so much as glance at it. That's how dim sum works but if you're not expecting it, it can be intimidating to say \"no, no!\" to get things you don't want taken off your table.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars in deference to the previous lovely times I've had here, and due to the possibility that 3-4 separate servers made mistakes and\/or they changed their prices and failed to mark them anywhere. If the latter is the case, that's just bad form in itself regardless, and this place is officially disproportionately priced. \n\nWow, this got long. I'm analyzing it like a breakup or something. Sort of feels like one..",

The atmosphere is like a lot of family-run restaurants--informal, comfortable, a lot of bric-a-brac all over.  The customers all seemed happy and talkative which I think is a good measure of the restaurant's success in making a pleasant atmosphere for people to eat.  And the staff was friendly and answered all my questions happily.  The guy who waited on me at the bar couldn't have been any nicer.  I had a Wurst Teller plate with 3 different sausages, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes (pancakes aren't shown on the menu) for sides, and a couple of Kostritzer schwarzbier to wash it all down.  Every single thing I ate was wonderful here.  Rich, flavorful sausages, spicy German mustard, warm and flavorful German potato salad, the excellent German beers on tap.  My only regret is that I ate so much that I didn't have room for dessert--they have some very tempting things in the display case.  (I saw a cheesecake and some other cakes in there like a German chocolate cake (which isn't a true German dessert, by the way), a black forest tort).  Also, I saw German beers on tap like Bitburger, Kostritzer, Tuch, and a couple others, which is pretty representative of the spectrum from pils and ale to dark.  Didn't see Spaten das Optimator, or hefeweizen, but I didn't look hard, either.  I asked for one of their world famous Reuben sandwiches with the red cabbage on it for carry out--it was terrific.  This was just one visit, but I really like this place and want to go again to explore more items.  Six stars if you like German food.",

As soon as I walked in I was greeted and asked if I had been there before (which obviously was a no) and then they explained the different sections of the store and told me that they would give me a bit of time to browse around see if anything appealed to me. I started looking at all of the frames on the wall and every time I would pull some off the shelf and try them on, I didnt like the way it looked on me or the way it felt on my nose. I did this a few times and still had no luck and became extremely overwhelmed very quickly. After about six minutes or so of doing this, one of the employees came over and started to pull things off for me to try on. The frames that he picked I would have never chosen for myself. And I freaking loved them all. I have extremely terrible vision so my lenses tend to be very thick and weigh down my glasses. He asked to see my prescription and recommended different frames that would be comfortable and fit well when the glasses were made. Two employees assited me while I was at the store and not only were they extremely well informed and helpful, but they were so incredibly kind! I've never had such a great experience picking out glasses before, ever. I've always been the kind of person that wears contacts out in public, but I'm definitely going to be wearing my glasses way more often because I absolutely love, love, LOVE the ones I ended up buying. And I would have never picked them out if it wasn't for those employees. I told my brother about the experience I had and he's going next week to check it out! I will never go anywhere else for my glasses. \n\nWarby Parker, you just got yourself huge fan!",

What you don't expect, is high end African fusion cuisine in the middle of Animal Kingdom.\n\nI dined here solo and was given the most hospitable experience I believe I've ever encountered at a restaurant. The hostess was kind and seated me without a reservation, my server was nothing less than awesome and told me so many beautiful details about the restaurant I wouldn't have known, and I even sat next to some amazing people who actually worked in the restaurant and were dining on a day off.\n\nI ordered the Lunch Tasting Menu ($49) with a Vanilla Passion Fruit Iced Tea which came with a side of Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup so you can control the sugar level. \n\nThe first course was a trio of a black eyed pea fritter, sous vide octopus, and butternut coconut milk soup with shrimp. Everything was exploding with flavor, and I was sad when it was gone. The octopus was fork tender and the sous vide process was utilized wonderfully.\n\nThe main course was from a selection and I chose a vegetarian ramen dish with a mushroom broth, vegetables, and a siracha lime sauce. Spicy, flavorful, large portion. Can't complain about an awesome bowl of ramen!\n\nFinally was my favorite -- the dessert trio. Deconstructed cheesecake, guava mouse, and a ganache with Egyptian sea salt. As a pastry chef, I understand and appreciate the refinement that goes into a well-executed plate of dessert; all 3 of these were spotless on flavor, presentation, and variation of texture.\n\nThe sophistication of this meal belongs in a high-end restaurant that can compete in NYC or anywhere easily. \n\nAt the end of the meal, you receive a postcard collectible of an original drawing tributed to the AK.

        "text": "A friend of mine gave me the \"newbie's tour\" of Desta last night.  Technically, I have eaten Ethiopian food once in Washington, DC, but it was about 17 years ago and I was a teenager at the time.  I think my parents chose what we ordered (or maybe the server recommended something) and all I really remember is the part where you use the bread as your utensil.  I've killed a lot of brain cells since then.\n\nMy friend recommended the Beef (Tenderloin) Tibs with Shiro and the Vegetarian Combo.  She also explained to me that while a lot of Ethiopian food is very heavy on the sauce, Desta uses a lighter amount of sauce.  They say that the reason for that is that they're proud of their ingredients.  I can see why, because everything was very good.\n\nIf you ask to share your food between the members of your party, all the food will come out on one huge plate together.  This allows you to eat \"family style\" - and also entertainingly reach across the table pretty far, although fortunately, the tables are small so the reach isn't so bad.  The restaurant thoughtfully provides hand sanitizer at each table, which is probably a good idea when you're eating with your hands and sharing food.\n\nThe Beef Tibs with Shiro was delicious.  I'm a big fan of beef, and this tasted like high-quality meat.  It was seasoned perfectly (for being tasty - I have no way to know what \"perfect\" Ethiopian seasoning is yet) and accompanied by onions, tomatoes and I believe fresh jalapeno pieces.  And the shiro was yummy, too - I love hummus so it's unlikely that I'd ever complain about a flavorful chickpea paste. \n\nThe Vegetarian Platter was great, too.  I wasn't sure of exactly what items I was eating, so I came home and looked at the menu.  After I looked at the menu, I'm still not sure of all the items I ate because I feel like there were things we ate that aren't listed on the menu and vice versa.  (Not that I mind not knowing what I'm eating, because I eat Korean food pretty often now that I live out in BFE and I usually only know what about 30% of the banchan items are.)\n\nAnyway, everything on the veggie plate was good (except that my friend and I did not try the halved fresh jalapeno with tomatoes because neither of us wanted that much fresh jalapeno).  Some items I remember trying were the collard green stew, the split pea stew, more shiro, a beet and potato salad, and a yellow-tinted cabbage dish.  \n\nThere was also a salad of lettuce and tomatoes and a red paste which I loved and think it might have been vegetarian fir fir.  Oh, and there was also a dish that was made out of pieces of injera (the flat sourdough-tasting bread that you use to scoop up your food) and something that tasted like olive oil and maybe vinegar.  From looking at the menu now, I think that may have been a fit fit of some kind.  \n\nMy favorite veggie items were definitely the shiro, the red paste, and the collards.  But there was nothing on that plate that I didn't like.  All of the items were served over more injera.  I guess I should have read the review earlier that mentioned that you are supposed to eat that injera too because it's yummy and has soaked up all the flavors.  Oops.\n\n(Yeah, in retrospect that seems like common sense.  But my friend was minimizing her bread consumption and my week at work has been rough.  I don't think my brain is functioning at full capacity anymore.)\n\nWith all the food we ordered, our total check only came to around 24 bucks.  Not too bad for the opportunity to try a million and one items (well, maybe more like 10 items).  I let satiated but not stuffed, and looking forward to trying some more things the next time I eat at an Ethiopian restaurant.\n\nMy experience at Desta was definitely enjoyable.  The food was great and our service completely on point.  The main reason I'm not giving a full five stars is that I don't feel really qualified to judge Ethiopian food since I have so little experience with it.  Give me time to build a basis for comparison, and this may become 5 stars for me.\n\nOh, and on our way out of the restaurant, we noticed that Desta has a drive thru.  Drive-thru Ethiopian cuisine?  Win.",

        "text": "So what is a \"Hopdoddy\" you ask, well on their main page of their web site it goes a little something like this...  \n\nHopdoddy was created to express the perfect union of burgers and beer: Handcrafted Beer (Hop) + (Doddy), the nickname was given to the native cow in Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nAnd there you have it, simple and sweet, but make no mistake this place is not so simple but yet the employee's are sweet and very hard working. Everyone from the greeter standing outside in the rain (yes it started to sprinkle) making sure everyone had a menu and answered any questions that were asked. She even handed out some umbrella to customers who were in line but forgot to bring one!\n\nYes, on some days (mostly weekends) you will be standing in some form of a line to get in and then to order. They only let in so many people at a time as this place is a seat yourself  burger bar. \n\nBecause ACL was in town and the last day of the festival was cancelled due to rain, everyone invaded the SoCo area looking for things to do! We honestly waited in line for about an hour. It is crazy but we were bound and intent to eat here. Our greeter told us what to do once we entered the restaurant as she let us and a few of the other people who were in line in. \n\nAs we were standing in line waiting to place our order, I decided to order a drink from the bar, I cannot remember the name, but it had bourbon and some other stuff in it. The bartender was friendly and made my drink strong. First couple of sips it was good but while we were waiting in line I started to itch and break out in small rashes on my arms and neck. I was super embarrassed walking back to the bar to ask for a refund. Both the bartender and the manager were concerned and offered to make me another drink. Not wanting to piss my body off anymore than it already was I just asked for a refund. The manager said not to worry that it is okay as I told her I have never returned a drink in life.\n\nOne of the servers came up to us after I got back in line and asked how many in our group, Minh said two and we were handed our table number. Was told after we placed our order that we could find our table to the right side of the restaurant.\n\nWe finally made it up to the counter to order, with all that was going on, I completely forgot what I wanted to order hoping Minh would take his sweet time ordering his meal I scanned the menu and found what sounded good to me.\n\n-Magic Shroom Burger with a gluten free bun, Angus Beef, Texas Goat Cheese, Field Mushrooms, Mayo & Basil Pesto.\n\n-Shared some fries y Chile con Queso.\n\nWe got our drink, grabbed some utensils, and found our table. Our waiter brought our food out to us and asked if he could get us anything else (Ketchup, Mustard ect) he even came around and refilled our drink a couple of times! \n\nMy shroom burger was cooked medium well and was full of juicy meaty goodness! The gluten free bun was light and airy and had taste not some stale cardboard excuse for a healthy bun.\nThis burger was huge (it is true, everything is BIGGER in Texas) I found myself having to half my burger which fell a part in the process of cutting so I could eat it.\nOne bite and I was hooked like a fish, the texture of the goat cheese and the mushrooms were the best part! \n\nThe fries and queso were good so good in fact that I totally forgot that I am not really suppose to have any type of queso at all. Sadly, I was somewhat sick back at the hotel for a little bit. However, it was so worth it! Creamy queso with a kick of spice paired with grease free fries seasoned to a prefect crisp. It is everything you ever dreamed of in fries and cheese land!\n\nIt was a perfect burger for a prefect cooler, rainy day in SoCO!  A bonus point was that they loved my fries and queso photo on instagram! I really like when companies interact with their customers! \n\nThree cheers for semi healthy burgers in Austin!!",

        "text": "Like everyone else, I went to The Eye Studio because of all of the wonderful Yelp reviews.  Plus, it was close to work, and I'm a sucker for convenience.\n\nI went to Dr. Tsai for about 18 months for a dry eye situation that I notice the most when I wake up around 3 a.m.  She had me wear my contacts less and less, go on steroid drops, Omega 3 pills, twice daily eyelid washes, warm eye compresses and what I felt were rather regular appointments.  None of it helped.  I still wake up in the middle of the night with eyes that feel like sandpaper.  \n\nIt was the same every appointment.  I'd explain what I was experiencing to Dr. Tsai.  She'd tell me that my dry eyes were related to wearing contacts.  I'd share the fact that I first noticed the dry eye problem when I wore contacts once or twice a year - usually for weddings.  She'd recommend that I wear my contacts less.\n\nThis happened three or four times until I realized that Dr. Tsai wasn't actually listening to me.  She had committed to a specific course of treatment, and there was nothing I could say to change it.\n\nTwo weeks later I went in for my annual eye exam.\n\nAfter the exam, Dr. Tsai launched into a lecture all about the long-term ramifications of dry eye, and how I needed to address my condition - soon.  I had to stop her midsentence and ask if the issue was really that much worse than two weeks earlier when she told me that it was manageable.  That's when I realized something.\n\nShe hadn't bothered to read my patient file before the exam. \n\nI get it.  She sees lots of other patients.  I could have been any one of the hundreds, which is why I have a patient file that holds the details specific to me and my desert like eyes.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I continued to work with Dr. Tsai and her staff while trying to find a new contact lense brand.  On the surface they give the impression that they want to help, but it resulted in a snarky e-mail from a patient care coordinator and the longest two months of my life.  \n\nThat's right - option one was a bust and not even the brand I had requested.  It took them over a week to even order option two.  Then Dr. Tsai tried to feed me a line about how it could take my eyes over two weeks to adjust to a new prescription. \n\nIt turned out that I didn't need to work through the headaches while my eyes adjusted.  The contacts had been ordered with the wrong prescription - specifically the wrong axis.  \n\nDr. Tsai gave me a song and dance about how each contact brand is different from the last.  She told me not to worry. We'd keep at it until we found the right pair.\n\nBy my next appointment, she had ordered the right axis for option two and ordered a third brand.  Neither of which worked for me.  Then she told me that we could continue to work on this, but I'd need to pay another contact fitting fee of close to $100.\n\nYes, I'm demanding.  If I'm wearing corrective lenses, I'd like to see clearly.  Yes, she ordered four pairs of contacts for me - three different brands.  I had specifically asked for one brand, but it wasn't ordered until option two.  At that point, someone ordered the wrong prescription.  \n\nI will only take responsibility for two pairs of contacts.  The other two are squarely on Dr. Tsai and her staff.\n \nAfter all of this, I still don't have a current contact prescription.  And, I'm officially done with The Eye Studio.",

        "text": "My best friend was in town and we decided to try this cafe because there are great reviews. It wasn't busy when I arrived with my friend, and when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. We stood there for a few minutes before the hostess walked up, and just looked at us until we spoke up that we needed a table for two. She told us that if we sit at the bar, the food is 20% off and when we nodded, she said \"seat yourself\" in a rude and unwelcoming manner. She failed to smile at us or make us feel welcome throughout this exchange. \n\nWe found seats at the bar, and the bartender was nice to us, although she took a while to acknowledge us and bring us hot sauce when we asked for it. I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our food was cold for the most part. When we finished eating, we sat for over 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged.  The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders. If anything, it felt like she was avoiding us. I understand that it may be understaffed but it takes two seconds to ask how everything is going. \n\nAfter waiting, she finally said \"I'll be right with you.\" \nIt took her another 5 minutes to be \"right with us.\" She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else, which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out, feeling even more unwelcome than before. \n\nThe food was mediocre for the price that we paid. For a nice and pricey cafe, the staff was very rude. I could have very well spent my money elsewhere that is even busier but still receive superb service. \n\nWould I recommend this place to anyone? Not at all. \n\n*** my friend is also a waitress, so we were being generous with our expectations and even with our tip.***",

        "text": "Not my first time here but it's definitely been awhile. I remember I used to come here based on the premise that it was the \"best Pho in Austin.\" I'm not sure if I really agree with that, mainly because I don't remember.\nThe drive here is always fun, as the restaurant is located right after a big dip in the hilly road. As I walk in, I always notice the empty buffet to the left. I don't know what time of the day they do buffet, because I have never seen it open (granted, I've only been here like 3 times). \nI guess I never noticed before because I've never had it, but the first thing I noticed when I opened the menu was the PAPAYA SALAD! Having had it at every meal in Thailand, it was imperative that I order it because I have yet to find it at any restaurant in the US. The menu offers it with shrimp but the waitress recommended I try the squid. \nThe flavor is not as strong and pungent as it was in Thailand, but this is to be expected. It still had the light refreshing taste of the papaya that I love, though. The grilled and skewered squid was a nice addition, making the perfect appetizing starter. \nI actually didn't opt for Pho at this visit and decided to try the vermicelli bowl instead. It had a good sauce, but for once I feel like they didn't put enough. Most of the time whenever I eat out at Asian places, it's like sodium overload. For this, there was a lot of vermicelli and not an adequate amount of sauce, making the overall taste pretty bland. However, once some of the vermicelli has been eaten and the sauce\/noodle ratio was more appropriate, this dish was actually very delicious. The portion was huge also, I had to take some to go. \nIf I do not find another place to fill my papaya salad crave, then I MUST come back to 888 sometime in the future.",

        "text": "What we loved about Hopdoddy:\n- Alex, our server. She was extremely attentive and friendly.\n- Atmosphere. It was hip enough for SoCo or any large urban city.\n- Beer Selection. A refined selection of micro brews.\n- Chipolte Catsup. Home made goodness, not too sweet just the right amount of heat.\n- Chile Cheese. We used it for a dipping sauce for our burgers... YUM.\n- Camaraderie of our fellow diners waiting in the \"40 min\" queue. It was fun to strike up a conversation about how this dining experience was starting to feel like an \"E\" ticket ride at Disney - there is something GREAT at the of this line and we will be reward for our patiences.\n\nWe really wanted to like our whole dining experience at Hopdoddy but the burgers unfortunately were dry and the accompanying veggies did not maintain their expected crispness. The queuing concept a la \"Fuddruckers\" could have been more effective if there were more than 2 smiling faces waiting to take your order. When we arrived this past Saturday night, we told the wait just order our food would be 40 mins, we were steps from the front door (.... and I \"know\"..... what was I expecting, it is SATURDAY night  for god's sake). Luckily, the queue flows past the bar where you are able pick up drink while waiting. \nAnd so like any good troopers, we made the best of our experience  focusing on the all of the things we enjoy about our evening - chatting it up with the people in the queue, marveling at the creative way an 8 top table could be transformed to accommodate a combination of various sized dining parties by merely moving a panel that resembled a large chalk board establishing a new line of demarcation, the amazing Chile Cheese sauce, and the fact we did try someplace new for dinner.",

Doubletree apparently has really gone down hill...I will never stay at another Doubletree again. \nThis particular location is a good walk to downtown where north market and the restaurants are so just be aware when making reservations.  We arrived and the parking situation is not that great, you share a public parking garage and it costs $22 per night with no valet. It's hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking. You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors. I could live with that ..the issue was the cleanliness and the service. \nThe king room was a very nice size but very dated and our room was not clean. Stains on the walls, bathroom was not clean , shower still had hair in it! \nThe bar in the restaurant is fine, if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn't know the first thing about making a drink. Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant. I was not expecting 5 star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible! The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon, stale bread and bagels, eggs were never brought out. We sat down, lay  our napkins out and were appalled to have hair all over our napkins! As if that wasn't enough that evening our neighbors decided to have a party until 6 AM . We awoke to very loud yelling and laughing, etc. about 3 AM. We called down to the front desk continuously but no one ever did anything about it. These walls must be paper thin because it was as if they were in the same room with us! Sorry, will not be staying here again. I love Hilton properties but I am done with this one!",

        "text": "Expatriate Games\n\nAfter going to Beast a couple of years ago and falling madly in food love, I knew I'd give Expatriate a shot. \n\nFirst things first, the website is a real turnoff to me. It tries too hard with its microscopic, unreadable black writing, clever titles and statements like 'open eight days a week.' Barf. Portland doesn't need places to try any harder than they already do. Let's agree to not give the rest of the world reasons to make fun of us.\n\nMoving along.\n\nCrab Rangoon--This isn't your favorite Thai restaurant's crab rangoon. The crab is so fresh, so delicate, so tasty. The won tons were cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet.\n\nIn fact, many of the dishes here incorporate amazing flavor combinations and a stunningly perfect heat.\n\nChinese Sausage Corn Dog--This was the only miss. My first bite was all dough and frankly, all donut. In fact, I'm guessing this is the same dough they use in the donut dessert. But as is, it missed the mark. The sausage is too sweet and gets lost in the sweet dough. The hot mustard is almost inedible, so there is nowhere to take this sweet, carby mass on a stick. Skip it.\n\nOnion & Butter Sandwich--Everyone knows that James Beard was the mac daddy of all chefs. Actually, I have no idea who James Beard was (is?), but I know if you're a James Beard chef, you're pretty amazing. I also know this sandwich of stinky, fatty, Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook items is heavenly, I mean completely divine in my mouth. \n\nBrussels Sprouts & Ground Lamb--True perfection. I'm not a fan of sprouts, I merely tolerate them. This is a complex dish in which every bite makes a statement and invites you back for more. This dish embodies a team--the individual ingredients are less powerful than the way they work together. \n\nKorean Fried Game Hen--Plenty of meat on this bone, deliciously fried and flavored. Like the other dishes, you practically want to lick the plate because it's covered in special sauce and other tiny, sweet morsels.\n\nThe space is great--modern, romantic, hip, intimate, but maybe a bit cramped and way too dark for food that amazing. It's like she's trying to prevent the food porn culture from plastering every moment on Instagram. \n\nOur server was really friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic. I thought it was a little much when the gentleman who delivered our food told us that the silverware was made of radon (see paragraph one).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Naomi Pomeroy proves that in Portland, it's quality, not quantity that wins. You don't have to own 10 restaurants (or even three) to make a statement in this town. In fact, I'd like her to stay small, stay focused and stay amazing because of it. \n\nOne of the best meals around. I'll be back again and again. Truly special in a town where the bar is set pretty high.",

I went with my son today (2\/23) on a class trip and he was very disappointed. \n\nFamilies with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. A big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. Lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38\" and up)\n\nFamilies with older kids (I'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, Mako, Kraken, and Manta. The height requirement is 54\" and they enforce it! \n\nFamilies that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. \n\nHowever if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.\n\nOn 2\/23 the one \"roller coaster\", Atlantis, my son (53\" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. So he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. \n\nHe also wasn't into the shows, which--I mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  \n\nThe food service was awful. I'll just say it. The park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. I'm glad we brought our lunch bc I can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food. \n\nThe cleanliness was average, the bathrooms were stinky but not disgusting. \n\nSo, before you set out, figure out who can ride what so there is no sadness on a day you're spending $80 ish per person just to get in the door.",

I ordered the electric lemonade it was delicious and kind of strong despite all the ice. I am glad I split the big dig fries with someone as it was huge portion, and really good. Although waffle fries smothered in cheese and sour cream,  you have to be  a real moron to mess that up.\n\nWhen I first arrived and was waiting for others to joined me, I sat at the bar next to some guy, who got meatloaf that didn't seem all that great, I caught some of his conversation with the bartender and he was asking her what kind of meat was in there, and said it was dry and tasteless and didn't taste like beef. She offered to call the manager.  We moved to a table after that so I don't know what happen with it.  I definitely  wouldn't come here for dinner. This seems more like the kind of place to grab a few simple dishes. The bar was a nice size but pretty crowded by eight, but it was Friday. \n\nOne last note the waitresses and some of the bartenders seem to be lacking in customer service skills. When I first arrived I saw them clustered at the end of the bar, I looked their way for a while, and eventually had to wave my hand.  There was a blonde facing me she looked over blankly several times and didn't tell the bartender who was in charge of my side that I need service so I ended up waiting a while before she came over. After we got a table the same blonde again,  asked us to move (without knowing we had permission from the hostess and waitress) on one hand I know she was just doing her job, but I felt like she should have asked her coworkers first, or even us before ordering us to move. It wasn't a big deal or anything, and after we told her she just said ok, so I know she wasn't trying to be rude. The red headed waitress who ended up serving me was great, although I  felt bad because I ordered from her then tipped at the table so I owe her one next time I go there.",

Shrimp was really good. Big and delicious! (Her words, not mines)  The salmon was so good!  It was kind dry, but a little lemon made the whole salmon taste amazing! Lastly was the catfish. No fishy after taste and was fried to perfection! Her sides were a side salad with Lemon Herb & Vinaigrette. (Absolutely amazing dressing if you don't like ranch) She also had steamed broccoli they were good. Just steamed broccoli...\n\nFor my 3, I chose the Atlantic Salmon, Crawfish √âtouff√©e, and Fried Catfish. I'll start with my sides. I had the Red Beans and Rice. It was okay. Sadly I think Popeye's makes it better. I upsized my side and got a cup of Gumbo. A little spicy for me but it was too good to not eat all of it! Very filling too! A bowl of that would probably fill me up.  \nThe Salmon was good. Again, a little dry but a little lemon juice put it over the top!  The Crawfish √âtouff√©e was scrumptious! It doesn't looks like much, but the rice will fill you up before you realize it. Lastly was the Fried Catfish. It was great! Cooked to perfection! Had some ketchup and some lemon. I had to take a fillet home with me. (That's right a 325 lb. man couldn't finish his plate.) That's how generous the portions are!\n\nFor an appetizer we had the Fried Calamari. My Fianc√© loves it here because it doesn't taste like you are eating grease. It was good but didn't WOW me. In my opinion it was a little chewy. I like my Calamari to be a little crunchier. Great taste though! I would definitely order them again. \n\nThere is one innovative item they have that I can't go without mentioning. It's this lemon net they have for when you squeeze the lemon onto your seafood. It kept the seeds in, and you didn't have lemon juice spray everywhere. Instead it made a controlled flow for the lemon juice to be spread evenly. It change my life! I'm never letting citrus fruit spray anyone around me ever again! \n\nAll in All I would rate this place with 4 Stars. Beer and wine selection isn't the greatest. It did get a little noisy during the rush hour (I know I'm being a uppity about a little noise) and for a Friday I felt they were under staffed. \nThe reason I am giving a 5 star review is because of our waitress Patience (that's her actual name) was freakin awesome! Attentive and fast. Didn't matter she was overwhelmed. She kept a great attitude and made our experience memorable. \nPatience if you end up reading this. You were awesome! If I weren't ballin on a budget I would have give more then 25%.  If I ever go back, I can only hope to get you again.",

        "text": "I was not happy with my service. I got a pedicure and a shellac manicure. \n\nFirst off, I hate that you ask them a question and they have people who don't know English. I get it, most nail salons are like that but it makes me question if they are even licensed to be doing my nails. The language barrier leaves a lot of room for misunderstandings.\n\nSecondly, they were in a rush to leave so they did my manicure and pedicure simultaneously which was uncomfortable because they were trying to twist my body in uncomfortable ways. The lady doing my manicure was skipping steps (. I'm a licensed cosmetologist so I know how manicures are supposed to be done) she also couldn't understand my English when I politely corrected her. She was standing I front of the tv the whole time so I had no choice but to stare off into space. At one point the staff we're arguing with each other which made me very uneasy as I'm trying to relax. The straw that broke the camels back was when the manicurist was trying to rinse my hands in the water my feet had been soaking in. She didn't speak or give me direction, she just pulled my hands rather aggressively down towards my feet and cause me to accidentally kick my legs forward. My left fiit, which was submerged in the water, banged against the tub. My right root was getting worked on by the guy doing my pedicure and caused me to kick him. It was very awkward and embarrassing. I even passed gas. The other clients were staring because of the yelp I made when my toe got banged.\nTwo days later, my toe has finally stopped throbbing.\n\nIt was not pleasant and it took them way too long to finish everything since they wasted so much time being in each other's way and arguing.\n\nIn the end I must say the older gentleman who did my pedicure was very polite and did an excellent job manicuring my feet from start to finish. I just wish his English was better.\n\nThe lady manicurist was horrible, impatient, messy and clearly didn't go to nail school.\n\nWhat a waste of $50.",

        "text": "WHERE DO I START? We brought the kids here for their first time, got there around 9:30 for a 10:00 opening and was glad when they opened early. However, it quickly went downhill from there. Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for \"technical difficulties.\" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! Dark clouds should not shut down rides! Anyway....\n\nAt Journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kinda took the fun out of the ride.\n\nOn a positive note, we saw the Dolphin and Sea Lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. I personally loved Antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. That was really cool. \n\nLastly, the park closed at 6 PM but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 PM to try to usher you out of the park. An employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. I have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it. To sum it all up, my teenager described it as a broken down Six Flags, but way worse. Save your money and go somewhere else!",

        "text": "Just a hungry yelper looking for something easy, off the beaten path, and free from logos and slogans. Well, the place wasn't as independent as I was hoping. Still a fair commercial feel going on inside complete with ‚Ñ¢s on the menu. Corporate places can get the theme down and polished but sometimes lack in authenticity once the place is running.\n\nThe place is kind of like a cross between Quisnos and Jimmy Johns. The sandwiches are very meat-centric. The feel of the place is like they were trying for a bit of an east coast vibe but the only part they really got to was the random yelling of words by the staff.\n\nI get to the line, browse through the quite large bottled beverage selection to see all the typical mass-produced overly sugary selections. Passed on the beverages. Moved passed to order my sandwich. Opted for A Wreck for myself who's ingredients read like an Italian sandwich, and a Hammie for the kiddo. It's ham and cheese.\n\nI was a bit impressed with guy1's calm demeanor in a place that's still fairly busy at a peak dinner time. Was preparing the order ahead of me while simultaneously taking my order and writing nothing down or entering anything into an order and he took the order calmly and confidently and didn't make me feel rushed and his demeanor didn't make me feel like he was rushed or over-worked.\n\nThe odd part is the yelling. Once I put in my order he yells out my order and the other two yell the order back to suggest that they heard him. This is a cheap gimmick pulled from fish markets and east coast shops. Guy1's like \"Hey, I'm making a sandwich!\" and the other two chirp back \"He's making a sandwich\/That guy's making a sandwich!\"\n\nIs this really necessary? Guy2's whole job is to take the meat and cheese bread off the toaster that Guy1 put in place and put your choice of 9 different condiments and vegetables on the sandwich for 8 hours straight. Should he really be so surprised to find a sandwich manifest itself onto his side of the toaster without the guy yelling into the side of his head from 3 feet away? I'd like to see some headsets secret agent style where they whisper into their sleeves that the customer who just walked passed them and the sign on the door that says \"Potbelly Sandwich Shop\" is indeed here to order a sandwich and is definitely not lost.\n\nI'm such a slacker on receipts. I forget to take them and when they tell me the total of my order they might as well be telling me what they heard on The View last night, because I'm not listening.\n\nA Wreck reminded me of a toasted version of The Italian Night Club from Jimmy Johns, but toasted and on ciabatta and smaller, but I think I ordered the smaller one. The hot peppers actually have some spice to them, where Jimmy's are sweet and zesty these have a mild spice that slowly accumulates until the end of the sandwich where it's still tolerable to my sensibilities. The cured meats actually kind of taste like cured meats, which is always a bonus. Sometimes at these shops it just tastes like a slightly more flavorful bologna.\n\nI nabbed a bit of the Hammie from the kiddo. (for science). The ham was quite flavorful where many others just taste like muted versions of themselves. Notes of smokiness and well hydrated without tasting like it was reconstituted in it's own juices like the turkey packets you get at the grocery store. It's truly noteworthy that most of the sandwich made it into the kids mouth! You parents know this means something!\n\nTo test the practicality of the yelling, I've decided to make this a practice at home when I'm up at 6:30 making breakfast. \"I'm making Cap'n Crunch‚Ñ¢!\" I'll update and let you know how it works in a week. (No I won't).",

        "text": "Moved to the Melrose area back in June and spent the summer months looking for a new home gym. I tried the closest Planet Fitness and WOW locations and found they were GROSSLY overpopulated. Getting a machine at either location wasn't at all possible at peak times, so I went to meet with Camille and Josh to tour Anytime Fitness in September. After seeing the open availability of machines, and the \"anytime\" access, I was sold. Even though the space may be smaller than the big box gyms, the availability of access spreads the \"busy times\" throughout the day where there's never a crowd when you decide to go. I've never had an issue getting a machine or weight when I need to and I am a regular visitor (probably not as regular as I should be, thanks for pointing that out!). The demographic of members is very easy going. No \"gym-rats\" or kids, every one is very respectful and clean which is key in a gym for me. \n\nEquipment set up here is perfect for me. It's got everything I could want to use from treadmills and bikes, to free weights and a good variety of machines to work out in any manner I could want. Management is also very accommodating to requests for new equipment and services and encourage members to come up with new suggestions. I have left a suggestion or two on the chalkboard, which is a nice touch. It sort of \"personalizes\" the gym for me. Very rare nowadays.\n\nFor any place I give 5-stars to, I force myself to also list a \"con\" just to show I am not TOTALLY brainwashed :), and the only thing I could think of here, and it's prevalent in a lot of gyms I have noticed, is a lack of WiFi availability I guess? Besides that, I can't find anything I haven't liked about being a member of Anytime Fitness. I look forward to being a renewing customer next year.\n\nEDIT: 12\/14\/12\n\nI am leaving the above review untouched so people can see what I typed originally. I don't believe in going back and changing the original review. But went into Anytime Fitness today to find a pleasant surprise.. they've added WiFi to the gym after a couple of us made the suggestion. That was my only \"gripe\" even though my AT&T unlimited data plan works fine. WiFi just helps on battery life. So that problem is fixed! Why haven't you joined yet?",

        "text": "My friend recommended Mark at 10th street tattoo. She'd recently got her first tattoo and actually went back to get another one from him a few weeks later. I'd been to one shop before coming here and I didn't have a pleasant experience so I didn't end up getting anything done. I decided to give 10th street a try since my friend had a great experience. I called Mark on a Thurs so I could talk to him and let him know what I was interested in and to see his availibility for Friday. I told him the size and words I wanted, he said it was pretty straight forward. I also mentioned to him my trip to the beach in a little over 3 weeks and he said I'd be fine. \n\nAfter work on Friday I drove straight to 10th street. I showed Mark the pictures on my phone of the words and symbol and showed him the placement on my body. He said it was great and he could definitely do it and it wouldn't take long...like max 15 min. That was great for me because it being my first one and not knowing what to expect-- the quicker the better lol. I felt very comfortable here. \n\nBefore he started the tattoo, I was able to see exactly where it would be and how it would look to make sure it was the exact location. I decided to move it slightly. I'm glad I was able to preview it though...being that it's permanent and all. \n\nOnce I got in the chair I tried to relax. He told me to let him know if I needed him to stop or anything like that but reassured me I'd be okay. I'm glad someone thought I'd be okay because I wasn't sure I was going to be lol. We talked through the whole thing which caused me to be at ease. It didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought-- actually it didn't really hurt at all. A few times it was uncomfortable but just something you'd grit your teeth over. He was done before I knew it. I went to look at the final product and was extremely happy. It was exactly what I'd been wanting for so many years. \n\nIf youre getting your first tattoo or a tattoo in general I fully recommend 10th street. They are great, everyone is nice. You can ask as many questions as you need and they'll answer them. The prices are very decent also.",

        "text": "The one star is not for their food. I ordered a laffa shawarma and it's solid. The one star is for their horribly rude service. \n\nI was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down\/wrapping up\/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.\n\nPoint of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM. BUT, with this experience I will NEVER buy from Yalla again.",

        "text": "i removed a previously written review in light of the fact that i recieved an email from a rouge employee apologizing for my experience which was nice and very proffesional.\n\n However i still do not suggest rouge as a place to go if you are fair skinned and are looking for a natural look. 50 dollars to get your makeup applied when the girl doesnt even listen to what you really want is unfair. It seems like alot of the people on here have had a good experience however i dont know what type of makeup they wear. Most people that go to get their makeup done want to look very done up. otherwise why not just do it at home. I guess if u are doing wedding makeup (although id really like to see an example of nautural makeup done for a wedding...maybe you guys could post some pics on your websites of a few different skin types.) then its an ok place to go. ALL i was saying is when i ask for no foundation and just coverup on any redness and undereye circles and just blush and mascara...DONT insist and then without my permission draw on pinup like eyebrows and a cateye as thick as my pinky finger. I just felt like i had no say in what i wanted and for 50 dollars i should be able to get whatever i want. Maybe the girl who did my makeup doesnt work there anymore as it seems the owners take their trade very seriously. In no way was i saying anyone was mean or unproffesional but being in the nursing field i know that the patient\/customer is always right so if i am paying for you to do my makeup and u have every color and everytype of palate to work with why not take the time to make sure your customers are happy. I was completley rushed through my appointment. i am a very nice patient person but i left there soooo dissapointed in a place that had me sooo excited to go to.Its very pretty and clean in there. Just saying be careful if u are a light makeup person and just make sure u speak up and say what u want and hopefully youl have a better experience than i did.",

I spent that $10 for you, readers. And didn't finish my watery dark and stormy (was there actually alcohol in it? I couldn't really tell). I was seated at a corner table downstairs, underneath an overhang. My brother only bumped his head on the ceiling once or twice, and the protruding corner after one beer. The beer list was decent (saving grace?).\n\nWe split the fries with truffle oil for the appetizer, I had the tuna salad, sister-in-law had another salad, and Bro had the much hyped lobster mac n'cheese. Hm. \n\nThe fries were hot, that's always nice. I could *kind of* taste the truffle oil, I guess it was a nice little addition to the fairly run-of-the mill fries, but that's pretty much all I can say about it. This might be a nice thing to get if you're just there for a drink or two (get beer or wine for yourself, seriously, avoid the mix drinks) and want something greasy to go along with it. \n\nThe salads were decent but overdressed--the lettuce on mine was good lettuce but I couldn't taste it because of all of the oil! The tuna was done really well, though, by really well I mean almost completely rare, which is how I roll with tuna steak. Maybe a straight up tuna steak would be good at this place, I'll never know. \n\nOk, on to the Mac N'Cheese. Seriously guys? All those people who raved about this stuff--do you really like the cheese to pool at the bottom of the bowl rather than being thick enough to be included in each bite of the food?? The taste was decent (I mean, cheesy lobster is really tough to eff up) but I thought the consistency was pretty nasty. The thin creamy cheese didn't make sense in a signature dish, and my brother started to wonder if he even likes mac n'cheese at all after how bummed he was about his meal. Trust me Bro, let's go to Zaftigs and get some real mac n'cheese before you make up your mind on that one.\n\nI don't plan to go back to this place. I liked the art, but there were so many older people there, it was a little weird to chill out with a bunch of septuagenarians in front of photos of half naked women.",

Our 25-30 wound up being 50-55.\n\nWhat can I say that 500 other haven't said already? Not sure, but here's my 2 shiny pennies!\n\nPops & I are of Germanic heritage. He'd been hankering for a trip to Frankenmuth MI - while I would rather have a pencil stuck in my temple. I suggested we try a trip to the German Village in C-bus and he was game for it. While the wifey is not a huge fan of german food I assured her I'd make a suitable suggestion from the menu for her.\n\nFast forward - we're at our table (seating can be tight when busy) near the Autobahn buffet and looking over the menu - prices on everything BUT the buffet, which sort of gives me a bit of anxiety. I suggest babe order the weiner schnitzel (she likes a good tenderloin, schnitzel is the great grand father) while Pops decides a reuben is in order. Our server informs me the dinner Autobahn buffet is $15 which I leap at. (and their desserts are discouted if you order a buffet AND its $3 cheaper at lunch!!!!)\n\nSorry you guys have to wait, I'm already heading to the buffet!  Skip over the salad and straight to meat - brats, bahama mamas, mild bahama mamas, knockwurst, breaded baked chicken, warm german potato salad, red cabbage, mac n cheese and sauerkraut. Should have gotten 2 plates!\n\nI loved my Oma's cooking but I wish she'd had Schmidt's recipes - especially for the german potato salad. Best ever and I must recreate.\n\nSome say the bahama mamas are spicy. Nah. But if you love garlic, and I LOVE garlic, you must sample their knockwurst. Guaranteed to give you dragon breath tomorrow!!!! For me the standout sausage was truly the bratwurst. Absolutely friggin fantastic. And NO, I discovered a few days later ... you cannot order bratwursts delivered online. Ye Gods!\n\nPops loved his reuben and sweetie said she was very happy with the schnitzel. [duh]\n\nSo the brat was standout. But our takeaway was the vanilla cream puff. We had to have it packed to go - no way we could eat. We 3 split the next morning at our hotel - wishing we hadn't just gotten one. \n\nNot sure when I'll make it back but certainly will.",

So take my review with a grain of salt because I went BIG at Artist Point and did so without regret. \n\nOf all the WDW eateries Artist Point is firmly entrenched in my top three. Artist Point gets huge bonus points for featuring an extensive wine selection from the under appreciated Pacific Northwest. I'm a pushover when it comes to a good wine pairing and always ask my server to match a glass to each course. Since they are trained in this and I am not I leave it to the professionals. \n\nI am a big fan of the artisan cheese course and like a typical American I treat this as an appetizer instead of an end of the meal treat. The trio of cheeses covers a safe yet broad selection of fromage including a nice cheddar, a creamy goat and a tangy blue. This was matched nicely with an Oregon Pinot Noir. \n\nThere are two dishes Artist Point is famous for; the cedar plank salmon and the buffalo. Choosing between these two wonderful dishes is almost a Sophie's Choice caliber decision. Of course if you know that Artist Point has an off the menu surf and turf option where you can have both you won't have to decide. It's kind of like getting your burger \"animal style\" at In-N-Out because unless you know to ask for it you wouldn't know it is there. Both dishes are wonderful and served in smaller portions when combined so you can enjoy both without being wasteful. \n\nDesserts leave a little to be desired at Artist Point. The signature berry cobbler just doesn't do it for me. The chocolate cheesecake and the clafouti (a rustic baked custard pie with fruit) are better choices.\n\nArtist Point is a popular restaurant so make sure yu contact Disney Dining for a priority seating time.",

        "text": "I've dined there two times, with differing experiences. I will review my most recent which was this past Saturday night. The place was full and the staff seemed a little in the weeds. There is no host or hostess to greet you, so we stood there for a good 5 minutes before being ushered to our seats. So it's a small room, we *had* to have been seen before then, not to mention that my friends are two of the tallest people I know personally and there's no *way* they weren't spotted! We were a party of 4 with a reservation which we were about 5 minutes late for - oopsie. I'm sure that's somehow my fault. Once seated, it took some time to be approached to give our drink order (another 7 minutes or so), and once we gave that order, it became painfully clear that a hostess was not the only staff member they were missing. There is no bartender there, and one of the waiters? the busboy? made the drinks. Which were quite tasty, but took over 10 minutes to get to us. I was beginning to wish I ordered wine instead of a Pineapple Martini (but I loooooove Skyy Pineapple, so I *had* to). So, we've been here for 20 minutes already and are just getting our drinks. The busboy did serve us water, which I drank right away and was not refilled. Even when asked. \n\nThe waiter was apologetic, but seemed to shuffle the blame off onto the busboy, and I'm not certain that everything was that poor kid's fault. In any event, we ordered our food, appetizers came out within a reasonable time (I loved my tomato, gorgonzola salad, and wish I had some right now). My dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs as well. But then there was a huge lag before the entrees. Like more than a half an hour, which goes by even more slowly when the drinks are being made by Slowy McSlowerson. And still no water! They brought more bread though, which I know tickled one of my DCs. \"You mean the bread started tickling him??\" No - it's a figure of speech, sheesh! When the food did arrive, the pasta e fagiole I ordered seemed bland (my Mom used to make it with salt pork for a nice meaty, slightly smoky flavor). This one lacked seasoning so I had to put a fair amount of salt and cheese on it to make it palatable. My friend ordered the chicken broccoli and ziti but wanted the homemade fusili instead which they goofed on and forgot. They did realize their mistake, though, and offered a free dessert. My other dining companions seemed pleased with their food (one ordered a veal marsala that I did not try and the other - my favorite - ordered off the menu, actually, a request they were kind enough to accommodate - it was gnocchi caprese with pesto sauce instead of tomato sauce, and it was gooeyyummydelicious)! \n\nThis is not a good place to go to if you're \"fungry\" or will get cranky because you haven't eaten all day before showing up. At least not on the weekend. The weeknight experience I had with my favorite DC was quite different as the service wasn't scattered or slow. I'll go back there, because of the value and convenience ($150.00 before tip for 4 people, all of whom drank alcohol and got plenty of food), but perhaps not on a weekend, and perhaps not to order the pasta e fagiole again. They were friendly and I always like to go to a non-chain, small, family-owned place.",

        "text": "We stayed in the Animal Kingdom Villas which were hands down, my favorite Disney property hotel thus far. I am a huge animal fan and for anyone else who is, you MUST stay at either the Animal Kingdom Lodge or the Villas within the lodge.\n\nNothing is more amazing then stepping out on your balcony and seeing animals. We had a balcony with a pool view that had luscious greenery abound with some animals in the distance. If you stay here, or even if you just go for a meal at Sanaa, Jiko or Boma, take a walk around the property! That's an order! Outdoors is absolutely beautiful. It is so fun going around checking everything out from the animals roaming around to the cool rockers placed around the firepit. They read stories some evenings. Also, when night falls, be sure to go to the night viewing spot and check out the animals with the night vision googles. It's a lot of fun!\n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful as well. The lobby is magnificent with amazing decor throughout. Get a tour of the AKL if you can!  There are super comfy chairs everywhere. We relaxed while waiting for a Boma dinner one evening in the couches, just taking in the atmosphere. There are some comfy chairs around an indoor fireplace which my friend actually fell asleep in front of as I was reading the story behind it. Plus, there are a couple of big balconies that overlook animal viewing areas which make for some fun!\n\nWe stayed in a Studio Villa which was huge! It had everything we could need...free Wi Fi (this is villas only), coffee maker, microwave, sink, fridge, all the mini kitchen fixens. We had our big bed plus a nice couch, table, flat screen tv, tons of space for the two of us. Plus, I loved the Animal themeing to the rooms (I will post pictures). The beauty was in the details of the room and hidden Mickeys were abound!\n\nI loved Boma their 1 TS restaurant, Jiko their 2 TS restaurant is simply amazing, I haven't yet tried Sanaa, and Mara their quick service area is great as well. \n\nThe pool is so beautiful! It's as if it's plopped write in the middle of Animal Kingdom---trees and greenery everywhere!\n\nThey have the usual great Disney staff throughout. I love their gift shop, as well! \n\nThe only downfall is it's one of the few Disney Deluxe Hotels that you have to take a bus everywhere. It's close to Animal Kingdom but not too close to the other parks so there are no boats, monorails, or walking paths to the parks. However, we had zero problems with waiting forever for buses here or anything like that.",

        "text": "At Barley Swine you are left in the capable hands of head chef, Bryce Gilmore. He and his team work to create the best dining experience possible. The tasting is $85; we also opted for the drink pairing $45. There were 13 courses that were paired with four wines and two beers. \n\nThey take pride in working with local farmers and ranchers to create small plates using fresh seasonal ingredients. As a result, the menu is ever-changing. \n\nOur first trio of plates, were paired with L'Conti Brut\/Blanquette de Limoux\/France. \n\nFunyuns and caviar, such a perplexing first bite. We were in for a treat.Pimento, this might just be the perfect hors-d'oeuvre. I could eat these all day. Beet Trifle with grilled mushroom and blue cheese cookie. This was oddly delicious. \n\nThe next pairing was Adelbert's Philosophizer Saison\/Austin. We were hooked from the first sip.\n\nYellowtail, carrot, pistachio miso, caramel - I thought anticipated this dish as a favorite, it was enjoyable but one of my least favorite of night.Morel, avocado - earthy, rich and perfectly creamy.\n\nThe next two dishes were paired with 2013 Weingut Robert Weil Trocken\/Rheingau,Germany.\n\nScrambled egg, crawfish boil. This was positively scrumptious. More, please!Carbonara, I adore it when chefs play with food. Squid noodles and all the flavor of a carbonara.\n\nThe next wine was 2011 Gerard Bertrand \"Grand Terroir\" Tautavel Blend\/Cotes du Roussilion, France.Radish, pork fat, smoked cashew - a wonderful surprise of flavors.Duck, radiccio, loquat - this was another dish, I expected to standout, but it was also a least favorite.\n\nOur last wine of the evening was 2013 Franco Espanolas Diamante\/ Rioja, Spain.\n\nSunchoke cereal, was the most unusual dish. It reminded me of Cocoa Pebbles, I mean that in the best way.Chamomile, berries - This was the best dessert that I can recollect. The berries had such intense flavor it was incredible! I ate my husband's too.\n\nThe final pairing was Prearis Quadrupel\/Belgium.Mesquite bean, chocolate - This play on the churro was very yummy, but I gave mine to the husband after a taste since I wanted to savor the berries from the last dessert.\n\nWe were blown away. It was a phenomenal meal and service was top notch. My two least favorite dishes were still wonderful, but they were familiar. I absolutely love when food provokes thought... when each ingredient is allowed to shine, it's truly a brilliant feat and Barley Swine nailed it.",

        "text": "I don't know who these sales tactics work on but I guess they wouldn't be employed if they didn't. We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. \n\nWe call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying \"master of excellence\". I'm sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesn't have physical space to display that.\n\nHe tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN we'll talk price.\n\nLet's pause for a minute. Suppose you're a Honda dealer and you honestly don't have a relatively popular car. Wouldn't you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, don't you? Of course, you would. Either he didn't have a car or he knew he didn't want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.\n\nSo he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess it's working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didn't stop. He called me like 8 times and I didn't answer.\n\nWe went to that other place the same day and bought the car. \n\nIn summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Don't ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesn't mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply don't know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.\n\nHere's a more detailed account of our buying process: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/silko-honda-raynham#hrid:k-v7aipcorfBAbBVzwWKcw",

        "text": "Warning!! Rant to follow. I apologize for length. \n\nI am dropping Potbelly a  couple stars based on our experience Monday. 2.5\n\nI really wanted to go to Whole Foods for a burger. ( different review but their burgers are solid: Sustainable, organic, delicious. )\n\nMom, said Princess, I really want broccoli soup and a milkshake. \n\nOk. Potbelly I guess. ( not excited about forfeiting the burger but she wants broccoli after days of only wanting pho. And I mean days). I couldn't promise broccoli soup at Whole Foods. They rotate their soups. \n\nIts 2pm. The parking lot is pretty empty. Its Veteran's Day.Usually this lot is nuts.  Theres a handful of people outside at tables and just a couple inside. .We stumble in to give our order to the girl at the counter. I order the chocolate shake first ( because it takes the longest ), then the bowl of soup, then a chicken salad sandwich on wheat( \"multigrain\" she says) then pick up some pop chips and head to the register. \n\nMa'am? What sandwich did you order again?\n\nChicken salad. \n\nOh ok. She says. \n\nAt the register my sandwich is sitting on the counter next to a tray (?) And I say \" is this mine ? And he nods so I pick it up and put it on the tray while he rings it up, then he notes the pop chips, reminds milkshake maker to get the shake and  says  \" a bowl of soup\" and as he rings it up says \" we are out of broccoli soup\" and \"you can have garden veggie or southwest chicken.\" He asks my daughter, \"do you want to taste them? \"\n\nUm no, says Princesses' facial expression, there are ONIONS in those. ONIONS are from Satan. Lets be real, neither of those choices is particularly kid friendly unless a parent has made them knowing what the kid will tolerate or if the kid had no food issues whatsoever. I don't have that kid. Mutely, pretty sad really, she shakes her head. She whispers to me \"I don't have to eat.\"\n\nGrrrrr.Really?! Then he goes and erases broccoli cheese  soup from their board. \n\nIf,  when I had ordered broccoli cheese soup, the girl had said \" we are out\" ...I would have said ok thanks and left. Or even better if I hadn't seen it on the board, I wouldn't have even had to talk to them! ( I do this at Fresh Thyme soup quite a bit. Go in, see what's left on their board...they're good at updating...and leave if nothing left will work). \n\nI couldn't do that now because I had a sandwich. Not a burger. Sigh. \n\nThe helpful register man gave us a free cookie to make up for being out of soup at 2pm. So my child had a milkshake ( which she ended up not drinking btw), a cookie we gave her dad later, and my chips that have less nutrition than dirt. I had a sandwich I didn't enjoy. This was not a successful lunch. \n\nAfterwards I took her to Java Mama's for a bagel. I needed coffee. \n\nWill we go back? \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe not for soup. \n\nWhat a wasted trip to Potbelly. It is cheap. But...they need to tighten up their ship a bit.\n \n*Disclaimer: The Princess, by royal edict, is not eating sandwiches currently unless its grilled cheese.",

        "text": "We are regulars at Marinepolis--one of the places that every member of the family enjoys, so it wins whenever it comes to a vote.  However, our last several visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices, and we're at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant.  This has caused a great disturbance in the force!  Hard to imagine we'll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be.\n\nOur visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general:  We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open, and one table was also vacant.  However, dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces, so no seating was available.  We sat on the waiting bench for 15 minutes (!) watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention.  Finally, one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes, and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter.  \n\nWhen we sat down, my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped, and a lot of it.  The bits of rice were especially sticky, so it was hard to overlook, and once we glanced down, our appetites diminished.  It appeared that food had been accumulating all day, as it was a dirty mess underneath the table.  The supplies at the table itself were all out, aside from ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce was empty, no sauce dishes, and none at any adjacent places, either.  To her credit, one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements.  \n\nThat was the one bright spot, though:  Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly, and we had to ask where they were before they showed up.  The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day, at least judging by their manner, and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby--not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish!  When we paid, the waitress at the register didn't say a word, no smile or thank you, no word at all, and I felt bad about having left a tip.  We feel that servers should be treated generously, but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired!\n\nOn the whole, this was really not a good experience, and in keeping with each of our recent visits.  I don't know if ownership has changed, or someone just stopped caring, but the place seems run by kids who don't know or care about cleanliness and customer service.  So sad to see our favorite restaurant come to this end.",

It doesn't matter what time of day you go here on a Saturday - whether its raining or snowing, be prepared to wait.  This time we had Mario who regrettably forgot about us. We sat in by the window so it was cool, we had the chance to people-watch as we chatted a bit about the current news. I've been here countless times.  A time when we got the new guy who had no idea what he was doing but we were patient. Another time when the manager came over to tease my bf about a Falcon's hat he was wearing.  Another time when the manager didn't even remember who he was. That was funny. Another time when we had to approach the manager about an issue. But THIS time was something different.  Anyway what brought me to write this review was because of the celebrity spotting - AmberRose...not to be confused with Yeezy's ex Amber Rose, not Whiz Khalifa's baby's momma Amber Rose, not the Amber Rose that refers to her Twitter followers as RoseBuds but Amber Rosario - or something like that. I heard the voice of a sweet southern girl who introduced herself to her table - \"Hi, Im AmberRose and I will be your server today...\" All I could see in front of me was my bf laughing, then he covered his face. I turn to my left \"OH, OK!\" and quickly turned my head before she could see that I was chuckled a bit. It was funny and cute at the same time. She was so sweet. I honestly wished that she was serving us because she would've given us the hookup on some extras if you know what I mean. Even if you don't, you have to go see for yourself.\n\nBesides that Mario was cool. I usually get upset when I'm ignored by my waiter but I didn't even see him walking around. I had so much fun that morning that it didn't even phase me.\n\nThe food is always cooked to perfection and it comes out quickly. I always get exactly what I order. I'm really picky about my eggs. I prefer shelled eggs - or country style eggs as they like to call them. I don't care if they're country or city. I want them out of a shell. The pancakes are always good. Although they slip on the hot syrup sometimes, all you had to do is ask and they'll bring it right to you.  The price is reasonable. You may catch a special every now and then. Other than that the staff is great and the atmosphere is homely. \n\nTry this iHop but remember, do not come extremely hungry. There's always a wait.",

I was craving Mexican food all week, you see, my family is from California,  and we cali folks love tacos. I can eat tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I moved to Atlanta last March,  and I've been looking for the perfect taco spot. I think I found it!!!\n\nMy sister and I decided to have a girls day. We decided to go see the new star trek film. The film was pretty good, but my mind was on food.  I purposely left the house on an empty stomach. The ultimate goal was to stuff my face. Me so hungry! The film ended, and we headed to the exit, my sister said, do you want to grab some food? I said, duh! She said, how about tacos? I said, yes, tacos is good! \n\nWe pulled up to bartaco,  and it was time for tacos. We entered the rather clean establishment and a confused gentleman greeted us. I overlooked his awkwardness,  and he walked us to a cute little table. I loved the cruise ship decor, I was pretty impressed, I was in paradise. We decided to look at the menu while we waited for our waitress. I was pleased with the menu selections. I decided on fried oyster, shrimp, and falafel tacos. I was ready to order. Where is the waitress, my sister asked.\n\nMy sister decided to get up and look for help. I sat there with a deep hunger. I want my tacos. This is pure torture. I looked up from my menu, and my sister and a handsome gentleman walked my way. He introduced himself, and he apologized for the inconvenience. You know what, he had me at, hello! I love good customer service. Christoph was an excellent ending to a rocky beginning. Christoph explained the menu etc, and he gave us tacos on the house. He left us in good hands as well. \n\nOur waitress Aimee was a breath of fresh air.\n\nAimee took our order. I ordered fried oyster, shrimp, falafel, and the lobster taco. My sister ordered fried oyster, fish, and the lobster taco. She ordered a mushroom tamale as well. We decided on gaucomle and chips. We both ordered margaritas. Omg, the food is excellent. Everything was super fresh. I'm serious, even the water was good. I was in taco heaven. \n\nI really like how the staff treated us. I felt like royalty.  The manager even introduced himself. He was a real treat. He was a chocolate treat.  \n\nI want to thank you all for a wonderful experience. Omg, I almost forgot. The manager walked me, and my sister to our car, you see, it was raining pretty hard, and he took out an umbrella and walked us to the front of the establishment. I got to touch his muscular body. I'm in heaven.",

My friends who still live in ATL discovered the restaurant and go all the time, so we came here with a group of 12 girls on the Friday night of my bachelorette party weekend for dinner and drinks.  I literally couldn't think of a more fun restaurant atmosphere and am so grateful for this place!\n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy, and looks like your standard authentic Italian restaurant.... if that restaurant was drunk (and I mean that in the best way!)  Everything glows red because of the rope lights everywhere, and there is SO MUCH TO LOOK AT!  Framed pictures and posters and signs and paper lanterns and chairs hanging from the ceiling....  And there are racks of hats throughout the restaurant that you can not only borrow to wear during dinner, but are seemingly encouraged to!  Everyone in my party borrowed a fun hat - mine was a sequined cowboy hat with a rhinestone tiara on top!  They play their music pretty loudly, and it's upbeat and fun.  The disco ball will randomly start spinning and when you least expect it the fog machine will go off.  And in the back room where we were sitting all of this organized chaos was offset by a large TV screen showing scenic and peaceful views of Italy.  \n\nThe food itself was average at best.  I started with the fried calamari appetizer and it was okay, but tasted a bit under seasoned.  For my entr√©e I got the \"classical rendition\" fettuccini alfredo, which was also just fair.  The noodles tasted homemade, but the sauce was also under seasoned and very oily.  Also, this place isn't necessarily cheap for the food they're serving - the fettuccini was $22.95.  But I think you honestly pay for the atmosphere and good vibes there, and that's why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 2 or 3.  That food for that price would have been disappointing if I wasn't having such a blast in such a fun place with my friends!\n\nThe restaurant also gave us all complimentary limoncello shots in honor of my bachelorette weekend, which was delicious and so very nice of them!  The bottle of limoncello was frozen in a bucket with a bunch of lemons, which makes for a pretty neat presentation (though it probably doesn't make it the easiest to pour).  Basically, this was the perfect spot for this weekend and we all really enjoyed ourselves.  They welcomed us with open arms and made sure we had fun!  Sure the food isn't the best ever, but really Atlanta isn't even known for having amazing Italian food so this should be no shock.  Come here when you want a place where the food is second to the atmosphere, and consider Il Localino for a fun birthday or bachelorette party dinner!",

        "text": "NOT RECOMMENDED FOR BIG GROUPS\nNot happy about the manager . \n\nThe food is 4star, We Have come here before with big groups before and never told to sit in 2 different tables. So much for celebrating my bday and not even be able to sit with my family. It was Tuesday 7\/28 morning and they said there is not enough room to fit 3 tables together. \nThere was 3 tables around us that were empty when we sat down. There was room to put 3 tables together, but instead he thought it was smarter to put 2 tables together for  6 of us and another 2tables together for only 4 people. Right there money lost for the restaurant, cause they could of sat another 4 people on that unnecessary table.\n\nWe got there at 11am & waited 40min to get drinks. Thank goodness I brought my own drinks for the kids. 40min for Orange juice!!! I ordered the kid meals with the drink and they still had to wait 1 hour for their food. While the adults waited 1hour & 30mim. We got out of the restaurant at 1:10.\nIt was breakfast at lunch time. They had to be understaffed, because I could tell our waiter was struggling, he was nice but feel bad for him for who he has to work with. \n\nThe manager came and \"apologized\", comped part of our meal. But it was not good enough. I still believe he didn't want to help to sit us together and used poor judgement setting up the tables. There was no need to put 2 tables together for only 4 people. They were acting like trendy snobby hipsters, I feel they would of being more accommodating at an ihop. I regret my decision of not going to kerbey lane instead. \n\nPlus the kitchen must of set a plastic container on and the entire restaurant was filled with the burn plastic smell. One of my family members had to go outside. NO ONE apologized for that, people on other tables were asking what happened kimberly is the greatest no one said sorry.\n\nIf you are waiting for a table right now or are planing on going here and you get there and there is a long wait. It is because the front of the house is not functioning right. It takes a long time to get your drinks after u sit down, and will take at least 1 hour to get your food.\n\nBreakfast was good. My 6 year old had the traditional Benedict, he ate the entire thing. My 3 year old had the carrot french toast. It was good huge serving, very very sweet.\nMe and my sister had the migas steak Benedict. It was good, just felt short on hollandaise, dish was a lil dry.\nMy husband had the goat cheese omelet with caramelized onions and artichoke, it was my favorite dish.\nMy mother in law got the traditional Benedict, she enjoyed them\nMy dad ordered the crab Benedict. The eggs were shaped like a poached egg but it was more like egg whites with spinach and bacon that were put on a mold. He was expecting a poached with a layer of spinach and bacon but he said it was still good.\nAs of the other part of my party. Couldn't tell what they had ordered.",

        "text": "This is the best restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nAfter making reservations with the Open Table app on my iPhone, my wife and I went there for dinner on Saturday March 19th.  We were impressed with the  modern looking building made of cinder blocks, glass and steel blending with the warm and inviting decor due made possible by gentle lighting, beautiful wood tables and warm red seating.  The oversized door welcomed us just as warmly as the manager at the front desk.  I must say I was very distracted (in a good way) by the open kitchen right as we came in.  I'm a huge fan of open kitchens because I think that people working in good restaurants are very talented, and I love to see how clean everything is and how hard they are working to give us a wonderful meal.\n\nAfter being promptly seated our waiter came by and introduced himself and asked for our drink order.  I made the innocuous comment that it was our first trip to Roaring Fork, and did he have anything that were house specialties.  His already pleasant demeanor peaked up a bit, and he made several suggestions for drink, appetizer, and entree.  We were given the perfect amount of time to peruse the menu, and I ended up ordering a Grey Goose Pear\/Amaretto martini, an off-menu NY strip, and the green chili mac & cheese (I'll let my wife, another yelper, tell you what she had).  We asked to split a fried avocado appetizer.\n\nA few minutes later the sous chef showed up with two \"tasting\" for us to try since it was our first trip.  I was deep into my first drink (fantastic!), and didn't quite catch what everything was.  It was a piece of seared Ahi Tuna (my first), a poblano rice (?), and a tomato sauce of some type ... doh!  I wish I paid attention!  I tried to look on the menu when I got home, but it isn't on the menu.  Well, it was wonderful.  When the fried avocado showed up they were perfect, too.  A warm avocado with a thin crispy coating served with a bit of spicy crab remoulade.\n\nDinner comes, and they ask me to cut into the side of beef masquerading as a NY Strip.  They flashed some light on the middle, and it was underdone.  They whisked it away with an apology.  The waiter came over with an apology.  The manager brought my steak back with an apology.  I was starting to feel bad that they cooked my steak to rare instead of medium like I asked!  \"No, no... it's okay.  It's fine.  Thankyouverymuch\" (I'm almost done with the second martini at this point...)  The strip was wonderful since they treated the steak the way you are supposed to treat any good steak.  A little salt, a little pepper, some wood-fired heat, and enjoy.  And boy did I enjoy.  The green chili mac was fantastic, too.\n\nAnd with all of that I wish I had ordered what my wife got!  (but, that's her review to give, not mine.  Check out \"Deanna B.\")\n\nThey comp'd a dessert for us, and although pleasantly full we couldn't refuse.  We tried the cornbread pineapple upside down cake.  (I'd seen too many photos of it on Yelp not to try it.)  Warm moist and sweet cornbread with pineapple rings and a scoop of Amy's vanilla ice cream.  I LOVED that it wasn't an overly sweet mess.  That was my kind of dessert!\n\nI wish I could live the life that offered the ability to have this quality meal every day (but not necessarily this QUANTITY!)  I said it several times, and I'm going to say it here, I have a new favorite restaurant - the Roaring Fork.",

Their Air Conditioning is NOT sufficient to cool inside, it was miserable and they had all windows closed and manager (she) refused to open windows early evening when it was windy outside and cooler than inside!! Scratching my head in that decision. Carne Asada Fajitas were great but flour tortillas in enchiladas are like 'Rubber' very disappointing and it was the same comment from two different people other than myself! \n\nWell after reading some of the negatives it reminded me that bad news travels fast and good news travels slow. If you're reading this you should remember to read between the lines and differentiate if you can, who's being accurate and who is not worth listening to. \n\nThe other reviews made me realize that there are a lot of people who live around here that have no concept of attending an adult restaurant. I always scratched my head why some parents bring children to restaurants that are clearly for adults when they SHOULD be taking their children to Denny's or some other 'family' restaurant! The last thing people want to do is to go to a very nice place and listen to annoying children being loud!!!! Or worse, a baby crying! \n\nThe fact is this is an obvious restaurant geared for adults. Our kind of place. The first compliment I want to give is to the ambience.  It is fantastic--from the decor to the very large windows that open to the street on both sides of the building. The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Prices were inexpensive, I think they should raise their prices! This would help keep a more high end clientele. In viewing the menu I knew the food was going to be good just based on their flavorings and descriptions. 95% of all Mexican restaurants make generic Mexican food! Yes, that food is good as well but, once in awhile you will come across a rare find. The only other upscale Mexican restaurant I have found is Javier's in Newport Beach, CA. \nAt Matador, the food was good. I like how you can choose a traditional dish but then they have variety of flavors and spices from which to choose for the preparation. The Queso was just ok, it's more of a bean dip with some cheese. They need to reverse it and have less bean dip and a lot more queso. With the Street Tacos they should allow you to pick what meat you want inside. Here they give you 5 tacos, each with a different meat and flavor. We found we preferred 2 of the 5. Chips and salsa were good. Salsa could be a bit more spicy. But the way they make it will allow more people to enjoy it. I would recommend having 2 salsas and let the customer get what they want. I like spicy, my wife doesn't.  The best plate I had was the Spicy Mexican Shrimp with habanero sauce and a Jalape√±o Corn Bread. This plate was amazing! At the end of the day I told my wife, \"Why would we go to any other Mexican place when we can come here for the ambience?\" Most people take pics of the food. To me it's all about the atmosphere. \n\nWe just moved to The Pearl and have not been to another Mexican restaurant in Portland prior to The Matador. No need for us to look any further!\n\nWe'd like to thank Corah our server. We enjoyed her company, very friendly and knowledgable.",

        "text": "My husband and I have been pleased with hooters wings and had pretty decent service at the last hooters we went to. This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. \n\nOur server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.\n\nAfter we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.\n\nAfter waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. \n\nAfter another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.\n\nWithin the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.\n\nShe ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now. If I do decide to go back to Hooters it will not be for a very long time.",
