We came here near Christmas time to buy some presents and we had a good experience. The staff members were very friendly and they helped us find what we were looking for. We got some golf stuff, two pairs of shoes, a tennis racket bag, and some bicycle accessories. The store was clean and well organized. They have everything from apparel to basketballs and everything in between. Good spot to buy athletic merchandise."

I knew exactly where I was going and should have just been in and out. I had my weights and was waiting to check out. There was one woman in front of me. There was one woman helping her and 2 standing there talking. I wasn't in a hurry so I just politely waited. When the one lady was done helping her customer, she looked at me and walked away. I stood at the register bewildered. Where did she go? How come no one wants to complete my sale? She finally came back and looked at me and turned away. Finally I spoke up... ""Excuse me, can someone help me check out?"" She turned back to me and said something about how she didn't know I needed help. How can that be?! I am standing at the register with the items I wish to purchase. She then decided that the only thing to do was be rude to me. She didn't even put my weights into a bag. I was so annoyed at that point I thanked her and juggled the weights, my purse and keys and left. I will only return if I have to. Dick's is too far to go when I just need weights, but Sports Authority has lost my business for all large purchases."

I was looking for golf shoes, and found some that felt good and fit well but had no price. Found an employee in another department and asked for him for help. While he checked on the price (which seemed to take much more effort than it should have) I found the shoes on-line for almost half the price."
mD-A9KOWADXvfrZfwDs-jw,Sports Authority,m2bBTGgCMgoR_FRhD2BbKA,1ENBskBHIvWPaiF-wcZ8Ew,If you are looking for sports wear or anything that has to do with sports goods or clothe you can find it here this is a mega store full with sports stuff such as equipment and even shoes but the lines may be long at times and some of the items they sale here are a bit over priced but if you don't mind paying a bit extra this is the place to go. They have some great offers going on now with even 70% off on some items.

Good to know they are still the best on the area. We got everything we came for and more. We were looking for shoe inserts and an exercise band and we asked the front desk young man. He not only directed us to the right aisle, but told us he will ask Mike to meet us there, which he did right away. Mike helped us find exactly what we wanted. When we told him if was for Asics shoes he brought out the same style Asics to try the insert in, which we did. The shoe was on special so we got a good deal and bought the shoe as well!! I even found acupressure footwear on special and Mike showed me others for a good arch and brought more out for me to try. We wanted a roller so Mike escorted us to where the rollers were. Its a pity that it was time for Mike to leave, but we were in good hands and Charlene helped us pick just the right roller, so that was really good. Thank you very much for such a great shopping experience. The front desk cashier and Mike saved us so much time, by directing us to the right spots a d then helping us find the perfect product for our requirements!"

However if I'm in a pinch and need some gear quick I can get what I need from them within minutes rather than days. Prices vary so you have to shop around, but every once in a while you can find a really awesome deal.\n\nI don't expect them to last to be honest. Too many other places to shop with better prices."
